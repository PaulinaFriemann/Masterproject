  abstract = {Many animal behaviours require orientation and steering with respect to the environment. For insects, a key brain area involved in spatial orientation and navigation is the central complex. Activity in this neural circuit has been shown to track the insect's current heading relative to its environment, and has also been proposed to be the substrate of path integration. However, it remains unclear how the output of the central complex is integrated into motor commands. Central complex output neurons project to the lateral accessory lobes (LAL), from which descending neurons project to thoracic motor centres. Here, we present a computational model of a simple neural network that has been described anatomically and physiologically in the LALs of male silkworm moths, in the context of odour-mediated steering. We present and analyze two versions of this network, both implemented in the Nengo framework, one rate-based and one based on spiking neurons. The modelled network consists of an inhibitory local interneuron and a bistable descending neuron (`flip-flop'), which both receive input in the LAL. The flip-flop neuron projects onto neck motor neurons to induce steering. We show that this simple computational model not only replicates the basic parameters of male silkworm moth behaviour in a simulated odour plume, but can also take input from a computational model of path integration in the central complex and use it to steer back to a point of origin. Furthermore, we find that increasing the level of detail within the model improves the realism of the model's behaviour. Our results suggest that descending neurons originating in the lateral accessory lobes, such as flip-flop neurons, are sufficient to mediate multiple steering behaviours. This study is therefore a first step to close the gap between orientation circuits in the central complex and downstream motor centres.},

  abstract = {The performance of heuristic search-based planners depends heavily on the quality of the heuristic function used to focus the search. These algorithms work fast and generate high-quality solutions, even for high-dimensional problems, as long as they are given a well-designed heuristic function. On the other hand, their performance can degrade considerably if there are large heuristic depression regions, i.e. regions in the search space where heuristic values do not correlate well with the actual cost-to-goal values. Consequently, the research in developing an efficient planner for a specific domain becomes the design of a good heuristic function. However, for many domains, it is hard to design a single heuristic function that captures all of the complexities of the problem. Furthermore, it is hard to ensure that heuristics are admissible (provide lower bounds on the cost-to-goal) and consistent, which is necessary for A* like searches to provide guarantees on completeness and bounds on sub-optimality. In this paper, we develop a novel heuristic search, called Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*), that takes in multiple, arbitrarily inadmissible heuristic functions in addition to a single consistent heuristic, and uses all of them simultaneously to search in a way that preserves guarantees on completeness and bounds on suboptimality. This enables the search to combine very effectively the guiding powers of different heuristic functions and simplifies dramatically the process of designing heuristic functions by a user because these functions no longer need to be admissible or consistent. We support these claims with experimental analysis on several domains ranging from inherently continuous domains such as full-body manipulation and navigation to inherently discrete domains such as the sliding tile puzzle.},

  abstract = {Building agents that can explore their environments intelligently is a challenging open problem. In this paper, we make a step towards understanding how a hierarchical design of the agent's policy can affect its exploration capabilities. First, we design EscapeRoom environments, where the agent must figure out how to navigate to the exit by accomplishing a number of intermediate tasks (subgoals), such as finding keys or opening doors. Our environments are procedurally generated and vary in complexity, which can be controlled by the number of subgoals and relationships between them. Next, we propose to measure the complexity of each environment by constructing dependency graphs between the goals and analytically computing hitting times of a random walk in the graph. We empirically evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with sparse and shaped rewards, a variation of policy sketches, and a hierarchical version of PPO (called HiPPO) akin to h-DQN. We show that analytically estimated hitting time in goal dependency graphs is an informative metric of the environment complexity. We conjecture that the result should hold for environments other than navigation. Finally, we show that solving environments beyond certain level of complexity requires hierarchical approaches.},

  abstract = {Odor attraction in walking Drosophila melanogaster is commonly used to relate neural function to behavior, but the algorithms underlying attraction are unclear. Here, we develop a high-throughput assay to measure olfactory behavior in response to well-controlled sensory stimuli. We show that odor evokes two behaviors: an upwind run during odor (ON response), and a local search at odor offset (OFF response). Wind orientation requires antennal mechanoreceptors, but search is driven solely by odor. Using dynamic odor stimuli, we measure the dependence of these two behaviors on odor intensity and history. Based on these data, we develop a navigation model that recapitulates the behavior of flies in our apparatus, and generates realistic trajectories when run in a turbulent boundary layer plume. The ability to parse olfactory navigation into quantifiable elementary sensori-motor transformations provides a foundation for dissecting neural circuits that govern olfactory behavior.           ,              All kinds of animals use their sense of smell to find things. Doing this is difficult because odors in air travel as plumes, which meander downwind and break apart. Scientists are interested in learning the rules that animals use to decipher these odor signals and trace them back to their source. For example, do animals use patterns of timing in the odor, differences between smell at the two nostrils, or the direction of the wind? Scientists would also like to know how animal's brain circuits decipher this information.             Tiny fruit flies make a good model for studying the way animals detect odors because scientists have already learned a great deal about how their brains work. There are also many tools available to help scientists study the brain circuits of fruit flies.             Now, \'Alvarez-Salvado et al. show that fruit flies use multiple senses to track odors to their source. In the experiments, fruit flies that were blind and could not fly were placed in tiny wind tunnels and their behavior in response to a smell or no smell in the tunnel was carefully documented. When the flies detected an odor, they turned to face the wind using their antennae to detect wind direction and run toward it. When flies lost track of an odor they began to search for it at the spot where they last smelled it. Next, \'Alvarez-Salvado et al. created a computer model that recreated the flies' behavior and was able to find the odor source as well as real flies. The model added together these basic behaviors to successfully recreate the flies' odor-search strategy.             Other animals are often better than humans at finding odor sources. As a result, people use pigs to find truffles and dogs to find lost hikers. The computer model \'Alvarez-Salvado et al. developed might help design robots that can search for truffles, hikers, or landmines, without risking the lives of animals. It might also be useful for designing autonomous vehicles that must respond to many types of information in changing environments to make decisions.},

Hybrid robots thus extend the roles of mobile robot experiments in neuroethology for both model evaluation and brain function analysis.},

Relaxing the 1D constraint, a random motion in the whole plane sets in at long times, due to random changes in shuttle orientation caused by bacterial collisions. The complex dynamics arising from the mechanical interactions between bacteria and the object boundaries can be described by a Gaussian stochastic force with a shape-dependent mean and a self-correlation decaying exponentially on the timescale of seconds.},

  abstract = {The conventional raster-based least-cost path technique, in which the connectivity graph is constructed by treating each raster cell as a node and linking each node to its adjacent neighbors, has been widely used to determine optimum paths in space. Unfortunately, paths calculated with this method are subject to distortions that stem from the imposed node-link structure. Due to the distortions, the calculated paths may be longer than the true optimum paths in continuous space, and because of this, they may also look highly unrealistic when displayed on a map. This study examines how the quality of the raster-based paths can be improved by using larger connectivity patterns on the one hand, and placing nodes on the sides of the cells of a raster instead of at their centers, on the other. In addition, the utility of the quadtree structure is examined. The different methods are evaluated against three different datasets using the cost distance of the calculated paths and processing times as evaluation criteria. The results indicate that raster-based paths can be improved by using the evaluated techniques, although the degree of improvement is also dependent on the properties of the underlying cost raster.},

The motion of bacteria within a swarm, wherein they migrate as a collective group over a solid surface, is fundamentally different as typical bacterial swarms show large-scale swirling and streaming motions involving millions to billions of cells. Here by tracking trajectories of fluorescently labelled individuals within such dense swarms, we find that the bacteria are performing super-diffusion, consistent with L\'evy walks. L\'evy walks are characterized by trajectories that have straight stretches for extended lengths whose variance is infinite. The evidence of super-diffusion consistent with L\'evy walks in bacteria suggests that this strategy may have evolved considerably earlier than previously thought.},

Determining what an animal knows about its environment, and how that information is translated into specific movement behaviors, is a conceptual challenge faced by movement ecologists. The modeling framework presented here is designed to evaluate the likelihood of alternative processes of perception, memory and decision making, based on readily available positional data and environmental metrics. The model is based on a flexible cognitive algorithm that provides the framework for an adaptive movement kernel. This enables a straightforward methodology for estimating key parameters for sensory perception, memory and movement while providing testable predictions of animal resource selection and space use patterns. In addition to describing the model and explaining the underlying logic, we demonstrate its parameterization potential using simulated data and investigate the robustness of its predictions over a wide range of temporal and spatial sampling scales. We show that the model can reproduce descriptive probes of movement paths with little sensitivity to the scale at which these paths were sampled and we discuss the merits of our approach in the context of movement- and cognitive-ecology and evolution.},

The new algorithm uses an expanding moving-window to explore a combination of cells that satisfy an elevation threshold condition and then supplements this by executing cut and fill operations when there are obstacle cells between source and destination cells. Cut and fill factors regarding the difference in the actual elevation and revised elevation are considered and a least-cost path is analyzed after calculating the accumulated travel cost to the destination point. After applying the developed algorithm to synthetic and real-world data, the least accumulated travel cost from the source point can then be calculated for all cells on the raster surface by considering various slope thresholds, moving-window sizes and raster data resolutions. This algorithm can be implemented as a useful tool in GIS software as well as engineering design software utilized in the construction and mining industries.},

Efficiency of navigation is important for behavioral processes at a range of different spatio-temporal scales, including foraging and migration. Random walk models provide a standard framework for modeling individual animal movement and navigation. Here we consider a vector-weighted biased and correlated random walk (BCRW) model for directed movement (taxis), where external navigation cues are balanced with forward persistence. We derive a mathematical approximation of the expected navigational efficiency for any BCRW of this form and confirm the model predictions using simulations. We demonstrate how the navigational efficiency is related to the weighting given to forward persistence and external navigation cues, and highlight the counter-intuitive result that for low (but realistic) levels of error on forward persistence, a higher navigational efficiency is achieved by giving more weighting to this indirect navigation cue rather than direct navigational cues. We discuss and interpret the relevance of these results for understanding animal movement and navigation strategies.},

Beside the high memory footprint, Occupancy Grid Maps lead to high CPU consumption for path planning. The situation is even worse in the context of multi-robot exploration. Indeed, to achieve coordination, robots have to share their local maps and merge ones provided by their teammates. These drawbacks of Occupancy Grid Maps can be mitigated by the use of topological maps. However, topological maps do not allow accurate obstacle delimitations needed for autonomous robots exploration. So, robots still have to handle with Occupancy Grid Maps. We argue that Vector-based Maps which materialize obstacles using collections of vectors is a more interesting alternative. Vector Maps both provide accurate metric information likewise Occupancy Grid Maps, and represent data as a graph that can be processed for path planning and maps merging as efficiently as with topological maps. Conclusions are backed by several metrics computed with several terrains that differ in size, form factor, and obstacle density.},

  abstract = {Humans are adept at inferring the mental states underlying other agents' actions, such as goals, beliefs, desires, emotions and other thoughts. We propose a computational framework based on Bayesian inverse planning for modeling human action understanding. The framework represents an intuitive theory of intentional agents' behavior based on the principle of rationality: the expectation that agents will plan approximately rationally to achieve their goals, given their beliefs about the world. The mental states that caused an agent's behavior are inferred by inverting this model of rational planning using Bayesian inference, integrating the likelihood of the observed actions with the prior over mental states. This approach formalizes in precise probabilistic terms the essence of previous qualitative approaches to action understanding based on an ``intentional stance'' [Dennett, D. C. (1987). The intentional stance. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] or a ``teleological stance'' [Gergely, G., N\'adasdy, Z., Csibra, G., \& Bir\'o, S. (1995). Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age. Cognition, 56, 165\textendash 193]. In three psychophysical experiments using animated stimuli of agents moving in simple mazes, we assess how well different inverse planning models based on different goal priors can predict human goal inferences. The results provide quantitative evidence for an approximately rational inference mechanism in human goal inference within our simplified stimulus paradigm, and for the flexible nature of goal representations that human observers can adopt. We discuss the implications of our experimental results for human action understanding in real-world contexts, and suggest how our framework might be extended to capture other kinds of mental state inferences, such as inferences about beliefs, or inferring whether an entity is an intentional agent.},

Navigation, however, remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents, with deep neural networks trained by reinforcement learning3\textendash 5 failing to rival the proficiency of mammalian spatial behaviour, which is underpinned by grid cells in the entorhinal cortex6. Grid cells are thought to provide a multi-scale periodic representation that functions as a metric for coding space7,8 and is critical for integrating self-motion (path integration)6,7,9 and planning direct trajectories to goals (vector-based navigation)7,10,11. Here we set out to leverage the computational functions of grid cells to develop a deep reinforcement learning agent with mammal-like navigational abilities. We first trained a recurrent network to perform path integration, leading to the emergence of representations resembling grid cells, as well as other entorhinal cell types12. We then showed that this representation provided an effective basis for an agent to locate goals in challenging, unfamiliar, and changeable environments\textemdash optimizing the primary objective of navigation through deep reinforcement learning. The performance of agents endowed with grid-like representations surpassed that of an expert human and comparison agents, with the metric quantities necessary for vector-based navigation derived from grid-like units within the network. Furthermore, grid-like representations enabled agents to conduct shortcut behaviours reminiscent of those performed by mammals. Our findings show that emergent grid-like representations furnish agents with a Euclidean spatial metric and associated vector operations, providing a foundation for proficient navigation. As such, our results support neuroscientific theories that see grid cells as critical for vector-based navigation7,10,11, demonstrating that the latter can be combined with path-based strategies to support navigation in challenging environments.},

Here we propose that at least one invertebrate clade, the insects, has a capacity for the most basic aspect of consciousness: subjective experience. In vertebrates the capacity for subjective experience is supported by integrated structures in the midbrain that create a neural simulation of the state of the mobile animal in space. This integrated and egocentric representation of the world from the animal's perspective is sufficient for subjective experience. Structures in the insect brain perform analogous functions. Therefore, we argue the insect brain also supports a capacity for subjective experience. In both vertebrates and insects this form of behavioral control system evolved as an efficient solution to basic problems of sensory reafference and true navigation. The brain structures that support subjective experience in vertebrates and insects are very different from each other, but in both cases they are basal to each clade. Hence we propose the origins of subjective experience can be traced to the Cambrian.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in spatial ecology have improved our understanding of the role of large-scale animal movements. However, an unsolved problem concerns the inherent stochasticity involved in many animal search displacements and its possible adaptive value. When animals have no information about where targets (i.e., resource patches, mates, etc.) are located, different random search strategies may provide different chances to find them. Assuming random-walk models as a necessary tool to understand how animals face such environmental uncertainty, we analyze the statistical differences between two random-walk models commonly used to fit animal movement data, the Le\textasciiacute vy walks and the correlated random walks, and we quantify their efficiencies (i.e., the number of targets found in relation to total displacement) within a random search context. Correlated random-walk properties (i.e., scale-finite correlations) may be interpreted as the by-product of locally scanning mechanisms. Le\textasciiacute vy walks, instead, have fundamental properties (i.e., super-diffusivity and scale invariance) that allow a higher efficiency in random search scenarios. Specific biological mechanisms related to how animals punctuate their movement with sudden reorientations in a random search would be sufficient to sustain Le\textasciiacute vy walk properties. Furthermore, we investigate a new model (the Le\textasciiacute vy-modulated correlated random walk) that combines the properties of correlated and Le\textasciiacute vy walks. This model shows that Le\textasciiacute vy walk properties are robust to any behavioral mechanism providing short-range correlations in the walk. We propose that some animals may have evolved the ability of performing Le\textasciiacute vy walks as adaptive strategies in order to face search uncertainties.},

With these sensors' features in mind, we initially present a control law, which allows a robot with an omni-directional sensor to reach a subset of the plane by monitoring the angles of only three landmarks. By analyzing the law's properties, a second law has been developed that reaches the complementary set of points. The two methods are then combined in a path planning framework that reaches any possible goal configuration in a planar obstacle-free workspace with three landmarks. The proposed framework could be used together with other techniques, such as obstacle avoidance and topological maps, to improve the efficiency of autonomous navigation. Experiments have been conducted on a robotic platform using a panoramic camera that exhibit the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed techniques. This work provides evidence that navigational tasks can be performed using only a small number of primitive sensor cues and without the explicit computation of range information.},

  abstract = {Olfactory navigation in insects, for instance when males search for mates, is a navigational problem of a self-propelled agent with limited sensor capabilities in a scalar field (odor) convected and diffused by turbulent wind. There are numerous navigation strategies proposed to explain the navigation paths of insects to food (flowers) or mating partners (females). In a search for a mate, the males use airborne pheromone puffs in turbulent environments around trees and vegetation. It is difficult to compare the various strategies because of a lack of a single simulation framework that can change a single parameter in time and test all the strategies against a controlled environment. This work aims at closing this gap, suggesting an open source, freely accessible simulation framework, abbreviated MothPy. We implement the simulation framework using another open source package (``pompy'') that recreates a state-of- the-art puff-based odor plume model of Farrell et al. [1]. We add four different navigation strategies to the simulation framework based on and extending the previously published models [2, 3], and compare their performance with different wind and odor spread parameters. We test a sensitivity analysis of the navigation strategies to the plume meandering and to increased turbulence levels that are effectively expressed as the elevated puff spread rates. The simulations are compared statistically and provide an interesting view on the robustness and effectiveness of various strategies. This benchmarking-ready simulation framework could be useful for the biology-oriented, as well as engineering-oriented studies, assisting to deduce the evolutionary efficient strategies and improving self-propelled autonomous systems in complex environments.},

  abstract = {Neuroscientists have long criticised deep learning algorithms as incompatible with current knowledge of neurobiology. We explore more biologically plausible versions of deep representation learning, focusing here mostly on unsupervised learning but developing a learning mechanism that could account for supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The starting point is that the basic learning rule believed to govern synaptic weight updates (Spike-TimingDependent Plasticity) arises out of a simple update rule that makes a lot of sense from a machine learning point of view and can be interpreted as gradient descent on some objective function so long as the neuronal dynamics push firing rates towards better values of the objective function (be it supervised, unsupervised, or rewarddriven). The second main idea is that this corresponds to a form of the variational EM algorithm, i.e., with approximate rather than exact posteriors, implemented by neural dynamics. Another contribution of this paper is that the gradients required for updating the hidden states in the above variational interpretation can be estimated using an approximation that only requires propagating activations forward and backward, with pairs of layers learning to form a denoising auto-encoder. Finally, we extend the theory about the probabilistic interpretation of auto-encoders to justify improved sampling schemes based on the generative interpretation of denoising auto-encoders, and we validate all these ideas on generative learning tasks.},

Understanding how confinement alters bacterial motility is therefore critical to model the progression of infections, apply beneficial bacteria for drug delivery, and bioremediation. Unconfined bacteria move via runs and tumbles, leading to random walk-like motion; in a porous medium, previous research has assumed random walk-like motion for bacteria, with a reduced diffusivity due to collisions with obstacles. However, this assumption has never been directly tested due to the inability to visualize processes in opaque 3D media. Here, we directly visualize the motion of single E. coli cells inside a model 3D porous medium, having controlled pore structure. By analyzing the individual cell trajectories, we find that the bacteria do not move via a random walk process. We will present how bacterial motility depends sensitively on pore-scale confinement. Our findings overturn standard assumptions made in the field and provide guidance for the development of more accurate macroscopic models of bacterial motion. Project X Andlinger Postdoc fellowship.}

However, morphological signatures of lifestyles related to higher order processing of information are more difficult to demonstrate. Co-option of existing neural structures for new behaviors might hinder the detection of morphological changes at a large scale. Current methodological advances will make it possible to investigate finer structural changes (e.g. variation in the connectivity between neurons) and might shed light on whether or not some lifestyles (e.g. eusociality) require morphological adaptations.},

The challenge is rising with each new generation of games due to progressively larger and more complex environments and larger numbers of agents pathfinding in them. Algorithms based on A* tend to scale poorly as they must compute a complete, possibly abstract, path for each agent before the agent can move. Real-time heuristic search algorithms satisfy a constant bound on the amount of planning per move, independent of problem size. These algorithms are thus a promising approach to large scale multi-agent pathfinding in video games. However, until recently, real-time heuristic search algorithms universally exhibited a visually unappealing ``scrubbing'' behavior by repeatedly revisiting map locations. This had prevented their adoption by video game developers. In this chapter we review three modern search algorithms which address the ``scrubbing'' problem in different ways. Each algorithm presentation is complete with an empirical evaluation on game maps.},

  abstract = {Grid cells in the rat entorhinal cortex display strikingly regular firing responses to the animal's position in 2-D space and have been hypothesized to form the neural substrate for dead-reckoning. However, errors accumulate rapidly when velocity inputs are integrated in existing models of grid cell activity. To produce grid-cell-like responses, these models would require frequent resets triggered by external sensory cues. Such inadequacies, shared by various models, cast doubt on the dead-reckoning potential of the grid cell system. Here we focus on the question of accurate path integration, specifically in continuous attractor models of grid cell activity. We show, in contrast to previous models, that continuous attractor models can generate regular triangular grid responses, based on inputs that encode only the rat's velocity and heading direction. We consider the role of the network boundary in the integration performance of the network and show that both periodic and aperiodic networks are capable of accurate path integration, despite important differences in their attractor manifolds. We quantify the rate at which errors in the velocity integration accumulate as a function of network size and intrinsic noise within the network. With a plausible range of parameters and the inclusion of spike variability, our model networks can accurately integrate velocity inputs over a maximum of {$\sim$}10\textendash 100 meters and {$\sim$}1\textendash 10 minutes. These findings form a proof-of-concept that continuous attractor dynamics may underlie velocity integration in the dorsolateral medial entorhinal cortex. The simulations also generate pertinent upper bounds on the accuracy of integration that may be achieved by continuous attractor dynamics in the grid cell network. We suggest experiments to test the continuous attractor model and differentiate it from models in which single cells establish their responses independently of each other., Even in the absence of external sensory cues, foraging rodents maintain an estimate of their position, allowing them to return home in a roughly straight line. This computation is known as dead reckoning or path integration. A discovery made three years ago in rats focused attention on the dorsolateral medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) as a location in the rat's brain where this computation might be performed. In this area, so-called grid cells fire whenever the rat is on any vertex of a triangular grid that tiles the plane. Here we propose a model that could generate grid-cell-like responses in a neural network. The inputs to the model network convey information about the rat's velocity and heading, consistent with known inputs projecting into the dMEC. The network effectively integrates these inputs to produce a response that depends on the rat's absolute position. We show that such a neural network can integrate position accurately and can reproduce grid-cell-like responses similar to those observed experimentally. We then suggest a set of experiments that could help identify whether our suggested mechanism is responsible for the emergence of grid cells and for path integration in the rat's brain.},

  abstract = {We review various features of the statistics of random paths on graphs. The relationship between path statistics and Quantum Mechanics (QM) leads to two canonical ways of defining random walk on a graph, which have different statistics and hence different entropies. Generic random walk (GRW) is in correspondence with the field-theoretical formalism, whereas maximal entropy random walk (MERW), introduced by us in a recent work, is motivated by the Feynman path-integral formulation of QM. GRW maximizes entropy locally (neighbors are chosen with equal probabilities), in contrast to MERW which does so globally (all paths of given length and endpoints are equally probable). The stationary distribution for MERW is given by the ground state of a quantum-mechanical problem where nodes whose degree is smaller than average act as repulsive impurities. We investigate static and dynamical properties GRW and MERW in a variety of examples in one and two dimensions. The most spectacular difference arises in the case of weakly diluted lattices, where a particle performing MERW gets eventually trapped in the largest nearly spherical region which is free of impurities. We put forward a quantitative explanation of this localization effect in terms of a classical Lifshitz phenomenon.},

Both functional and anatomical evidence point to principal cell diversity, modularity and columnar organization, but linking entorhinal anatomy and physiology remains challenging. Layer 2 microcircuits consist of pyramidal neurons and a stellate cell network, which lacks recurrent excitation and is coupled by disynaptic inhibition. Intracellular recordings showed that periodic, grid-like firing emerges from depolarization ramps, whereas theta-oscillations determine spike timing. Interference with various inputs to entorhinal cortex abolishes grid activity, often without concomitant loss of hippocampal place activity.},

  abstract = {Five key topics have been reverberating in hippocampal-entorhinal cortex (EC) research over the past five decades: episodic and semantic memory, path integration ("dead reckoning") and landmark ("map") navigation, and theta oscillation. We suggest that the systematic relations between single cell discharge and the activity of neuronal ensembles reflected in local field theta oscillations provide a useful insight into the relationship among these terms. In rats trained to run in direction-guided (1-dimensional) tasks, hippocampal cell assemblies discharge sequentially, with different assemblies active on opposite runs, i.e., place cells are unidirectional. Such tasks do not require map representation and are formally identical with learning sequentially occurring items in an episode. Hebbian plasticity, acting within the temporal window of the theta cycle, converts the travel distances into synaptic strengths between the sequentially activated and unidirectionally connected assemblies. In contrast, place representations by hippocampal neurons in 2-dimensional environments are typically omnidirectional, characteristic of a map. Generation of a map requires exploration, essentially a dead reckoning behavior. We suggest that omnidirectional navigation through the same places (junctions) during exploration gives rise to omnidirectional place cells and, consequently, maps free of temporal context. Analogously, multiple crossings of common junction(s) of episodes convert the common junction(s) into context-free or semantic memory. Theta oscillation can hence be conceived as the navigation rhythm through both physical and mnemonic space, facilitating the formation of maps and episodic/semantic memories.},

  abstract = {Homing endonuclease gene (HEG) drive is a promising insect population control technique that employs meganucleases to impair the fitness of pest populations. Our previous studies showed that HEG drive was more difficult to achieve in Drosophila melanogaster than Anopheles gambiae and we therefore investigated ways of improving homing performance in Drosophila. We show that homing in Drosophila responds to increased expression of HEGs specifically during the spermatogonia stage and this could be achieved through improved construct design. We found that 3{${'}$}-UTR choice was important to maximise expression levels, with HEG activity increasing as we employed Hsp70, SV40, vasa and {$\beta$}Tub56D derived UTRs. We also searched for spermatogonium-specific promoters and found that the Rcd-1r promoter was able to drive specific expression at this stage. Since Rcd-1 is a regulator of differentiation in other species, it suggests that Rcd-1r may serve a similar role during spermatogonial differentiation in Drosophila. Contrary to expectations, a fragment containing the entire region between the TBPH gene and the bgcn translational start drove strong HEG expression only during late spermatogenesis rather than in the germline stem cells and spermatogonia as expected. We also observed that the fraction of targets undergoing homing was temperature-sensitive, falling nearly four-fold when the temperature was lowered to 18\textdegree C. Taken together, this study demonstrates how a few simple measures can lead to substantial improvements in the HEG-based gene drive strategy and reinforce the idea that the HEG approach may be widely applicable to a variety of insect control programs.},

I review how this repertoire serves ants in making up for the lack of a locale system. Path integration\textemdash keeping track of the straight-line distance and direction from the starting point\textemdash operates continuously in the background, and can be called upon as necessary, or relied on in habitats in which no useful visual cues are available.

The entire repertoire is backed up by systematic search strategies. I end with some reflections on the power of taxon-like strategies. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Home is a special location for many animals, offering shelter from the elements, protection from predation, and a common place for gathering of the same species. Not surprisingly, many species have evolved efficient, robust homing strategies, which are used as part of each and every foraging journey. A basic strategy used by most animals is to take the shortest possible route home by accruing the net distances and directions travelled during foraging, a strategy well known as path integration. This strategy is part of the navigation toolbox of ants occupying different landscapes. However, when there is a visual discrepancy between test and training conditions, the distance travelled by animals relying on the path integrator varies dramatically between species: from 90\% of the home vector to an absolute distance of only 50 cm. We here ask what the theoretically optimal balance between PI-driven and landmark-driven navigation should be. In combination with well-established results from optimal search theory, we show analytically that this fractional use of the home vector is an optimal homing strategy under a variety of circumstances. Assuming there is a familiar route that an ant recognizes, theoretically optimal search should always begin at some fraction of the home vector, depending on the region of familiarity. These results are shown to be largely independent of the search algorithm used. Ant species from different habitats appear to have optimized their navigation strategy based on the availability and nature of navigational information content in their environment.},

  abstract = {Exact closed form mathematical solutions are reported which quantify the dynamic uncertainty resulting from path integration (PI) along tortuous paths. Based on a correlated random walk model, the derived results quantify positional estimation error moments with and without a compass, in discrete and continuous time. Consistent with earlier studies on attempted straight-line navigation, using a compass significantly reduces the uncertainty during PI, making purely idiothetic PI biologically implausible except over short distances. Examples are used to illustrate the contributions of angular noise, linear noise and path tortuosity, under different conditions. Linear noise is shown to be relatively more important with a compass while angular noise is more important without. It is shown that increasing path tortuosity decreases positional uncertainty, true for long and short journeys, irrespective of whether a compass is used, or the level of noise. In contrast, reducing angular noise also reduces uncertainty, but only below some critical level of noise. Using canonical equations of PI, it is shown that polar PI using a compass accumulates uncertainty in a manner similar to Cartesian PI without a compass. Issues of data sampling bias and intermittent use of a compass are also considered for PI along tortuous paths.},

This map represents the whole environment as a skeleton, using nodes similar to vectors independent of geometrical information of obstacles. To build a vector-based topological map, the following are developed: (a) acquisition of reliable range values using local minimum values, (b) fuzzy inference system (FIS) for extracting available directions, and (c) collision avoidance using virtual Jacobians. First, only local minimum values are used among the range of sensor values in order to decrease the effect of specular reflection and calculate available directions using the FIS. Specially, the number of consequent membership functions is determined as the number of obstacle orientations around a mobile robot, enabling the mobile robot to find available directions independently of the geometrical information of obstacles. Finally, to avoid collisions, a virtual Jacobian method is used because a vector-based topological map does not include the geometrical information about obstacles. The proposed algorithms have been verified in the simulation and implemented on a robot in the real environment.},

  abstract = {The problem of finding the least-cost path from a source point to a destination point can be dealt with by routing across a continuous surface or routing along a discrete network. The solutions within these two contexts are linked to the use of a raster- or a vector-based least-cost path algorithm. This study presents a technique which integrates raster- and vector-based least-cost path algorithms for determining the least-cost path across a continuous raster surface with discrete vector networks. The technique incorporates ancillary vector data sets that are required to examine the travel cost at each link, connections between nodes, and the representation of intersecting links in the discrete vector network into raster-based least-cost path analysis. The integrated technique presented here is applicable to all-terrain vehicle navigation where a continuous raster surface and discrete vector networks need to be considered simultaneously in order to find least-cost paths. This paper describes the concept behind, and details of, the integrated technique. Applications of the technique with synthetic and real-world data sets are also presented. They provide proof that the technique is effective in finding least-cost paths across a continuous raster surface with discrete vector networks.},

  abstract = {Mathematical modelling of the movement of animals, micro-organisms and cells is of great relevance in the fields of biology, ecology and medicine. Movement models can take many different forms, but the most widely used are based on the extensions of simple random walk processes. In this review paper, our aim is twofold: to introduce the mathematics behind random walks in a straightforward manner and to explain how such models can be used to aid our understanding of biological processes. We introduce the mathematical theory behind the simple random walk and explain how this relates to Brownian motion and diffusive processes in general. We demonstrate how these simple models can be extended to include drift and waiting times or be used to calculate first passage times. We discuss biased random walks and show how hyperbolic models can be used to generate correlated random walks. We cover two main applications of the random walk model. Firstly, we review models and results relating to the movement, dispersal and population redistribution of animals and micro-organisms. This includes direct calculation of mean squared displacement, mean dispersal distance, tortuosity measures, as well as possible limitations of these model approaches. Secondly, oriented movement and chemotaxis models are reviewed. General hyperbolic models based on the linear transport equation are introduced and we show how a reinforced random walk can be used to model movement where the individual changes its environment. We discuss the applications of these models in the context of cell migration leading to blood vessel growth (angiogenesis). Finally, we discuss how the various random walk models and approaches are related and the connections that underpin many of the key processes involved.},

  abstract = {A wide variety of insects use spatial memories in behaviours like holding a position in air or flowing water, in returning to a place of safety, and in foraging. The Hymenoptera, in particular, have evolved life-histories requiring reliable spatial memories to support the task of provisioning their young. Behavioural experiments, primarily on social bees and ants, reveal the mechanisms by which these memories are employed for guidance to spatial goals and suggest how the memories, and the processing streams that use them, may be organized. We discuss three types of memory-based guidance which, together, can explain a large part of observed insect spatial behaviour. Two of these, alignment image-matching and positional image-matching, are based on an insect's remembered views of its surroundings: The first uses views to keep to a familiar heading and the second to head towards a familiar place. The third type of guidance is based on a process of path integration by which an insect monitors its distance and direction from its nest through odometric and compass information. To a large degree, these guidance mechanisms appear to involve modular computational systems. We discuss the lack of evidence for cognitive maps in insects, and in particular the evidence against a map based on path integration, in which view-based and path integration memories might be combined. We suggest instead that insects have a collective of separate guidance systems, which cooperate and train each other, and together provide reliable guidance over a range of conditions.},

  abstract = {Developing whole-brain emulation (WBE) technology would provide immense benefits across neuroscience, biomedicine, artificial intelligence, and robotics. At this time, constructing a simulated human brain lacks feasibility due to limited experimental data and limited computational resources. However, I suggest that progress towards this goal might be accelerated by working towards an intermediate objective, namely insect brain emulation (IBE). More specifically, this would entail creating biologically realistic simulations of entire insect nervous systems along with more approximate simulations of non-neuronal insect physiology to make ``virtual insects.'' I argue that this could be realistically achievable within the next 20 years. I propose that developing emulations of insect brains will galvanize the global community of scientists, businesspeople, and policymakers towards pursuing the loftier goal of emulating the human brain. By demonstrating that WBE is possible via IBE, simulating mammalian brains and eventually the human brain may no longer be viewed as too radically ambitious to deserve substantial funding and resources. Furthermore, IBE will facilitate dramatic advances in cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and robotics through studies performed using virtual insects.},

  abstract = {The insect central complex (CX) is an enigmatic structure whose computational function has evaded inquiry, but has been implicated in a wide range of behaviours. Recent experimental evidence from the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) and the cockroach (Blaberus discoidalis) has demonstrated the existence of neural activity corresponding to the animal's orientation within a virtual arena (a neural `compass'), and this provides an insight into one component of the CX structure. There are two key features of the compass activity: an offset between the angle represented by the compass and the true angular position of visual features in the arena, and the remapping of the 270\textdegree{} visual arena onto an entire circle of neurons in the compass. Here we present a computational model which can reproduce this experimental evidence in detail, and predicts the computational mechanisms that underlie the data. We predict that both the offset and remapping of the fly's orientation onto the neural compass can be explained by plasticity in the synaptic weights between segments of the visual field and the neurons representing orientation. Furthermore, we predict that this learning is reliant on the existence of neural pathways that detect rotational motion across the whole visual field and uses this rotation signal to drive the rotation of activity in a neural ring attractor. Our model also reproduces the `transitioning' between visual landmarks seen when rotationally symmetric landmarks are presented. This model can provide the basis for further investigation into the role of the central complex, which promises to be a key structure for understanding insect behaviour, as well as suggesting approaches towards creating fully autonomous robotic agents.},

  abstract = {In many animals the ability to navigate over long distances is an important prerequisite for foraging. For example, it is widely accepted that desert ants and honey bees, but also mammals, use path integration for finding the way back to their home site. It is however a matter of a long standing debate whether animals in addition are able to acquire and use so called cognitive maps. Such a `map', a global spatial representation of the foraging area, is generally assumed to allow the animal to find shortcuts between two sites although the direct connection has never been travelled before. Using the artificial neural network approach, here we develop an artificial memory system which is based on path integration and various landmark guidance mechanisms (a bank of individual and independent landmark-defined memory elements). Activation of the individual memory elements depends on a separate motivation network and an, in part, asymmetrical lateral inhibition network. The information concerning the absolute position of the agent is present, but resides in a separate memory that can only be used by the path integration subsystem to control the behaviour, but cannot be used for computational purposes with other memory elements of the system. Thus, in this simulation there is no neural basis of a cognitive map. Nevertheless, an agent controlled by this network is able to accomplish various navigational tasks known from ants and bees and often discussed as being dependent on a cognitive map. For example, map-like behaviour as observed in honey bees arises as an emergent property from a decentralized system. This behaviour thus can be explained without referring to the assumption that a cognitive map, a coherent representation of foraging space, must exist. We hypothesize that the proposed network essentially resides in the mushroom bodies of the insect brain.},

Bio-inspired computing optimization algorithms is an emerging approach which is based on the principles and inspiration of the biological evolution of nature to develop new and robust competing techniques. In the last years, the bio-inspired optimization algorithms are recognized in machine learning to address the optimal solutions of complex problems in science and engineering. However, these problems are usually nonlinear and restricted to multiple nonlinear constraints which propose many problems such as time requirements and high dimensionality to find the optimal solution. To tackle the problems of the traditional optimization algorithms, the recent trends tend to apply bio-inspired optimization algorithms which represent a promising approach for solving complex optimization problems. This paper presents state-of-art of nine of recent bio-inspired algorithms, gap analysis, and its applications namely; Genetic Bee Colony (GBC) Algorithm, Fish Swarm Algorithm (FSA), Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA), Elephant Search Algorithm (ESA), Chicken Swarm Optimization Algorithm (CSOA), Moth flame optimization (MFO), and Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) algorithm. The previous related works are collected from Scopus databases are presented. Also, we explore some key issues in optimization and some applications for further research. We also analyze in-depth discussions the essence of these algorithms and their connections to self-organization and its applications in different areas of research are presented. As a result, the proposed analysis of these algorithms leads to some key problems that have to be addressed in the future.},

We use a computational model to test whether hypothesised sensorimotor control mechanisms are sufficient to account for larval behaviour. The model combines three mechanisms based on simple transformations of the recent history of odour intensity at the head location. The first is an increased probability of terminating runs in response to gradually decreasing concentration, the second an increased probability of terminating head casts in response to rapidly increasing concentration, and the third a biasing of run directions up concentration gradients through modulation of small head casts. We show that this model can be tuned to produce behavioural statistics comparable to those reported for the larva, and that this tuning results in similar chemotaxis performance to the larva. We demonstrate that each mechanism can enable odour approach but the combination of mechanisms is most effective, and investigate how these low-level control mechanisms relate to behavioural measures such as the preference indices used to investigate larval learning behaviour in group assays.},

The paradigm of fuzzy sets is introduced and two inferencing methods, the Mamdani model and the Takagi\textendash Sugeno\textendash Kang (TSK) model, are discussed. The genesis of brain modelling and its approximation so as to develop neural networks that can learn are also discussed. Two very popular computational intelligence techniques, support vector machines (SVMs) and rough sets, are introduced. The notions of hybridization that have aroused interest in developing new algorithms by using the better features of different techniques are mentioned. Each section contains applications of the respective technique in diverse domains.},

The use of UAV has been increased to replace humans in performing risky missions at adversarial environments and thus, the requirement of path planning with efficient energy consumption is necessary. This study analyses all the available path planning algorithms in terms of energy efficiency for a UAV. At the same time, the consideration is also given to the computation time, path length and completeness because UAV must compute a stealthy and minimal path length to save energy. Its range is limited and hence, time spent over a surveyed territory should be minimal, which in turn makes path length always a factor in any algorithm. Also the path must have a realistic trajectory and should be feasible for the UAV.},

As a result of this organization, ant colonies can accomplish complex tasks that in some cases far exceed the individual capacities of a single ant. The study of ant colonies behavior and of their self-organizing capacities is interesting for computer scientists because it provides models of distributed organization which are useful to solve difficult optimization and distributed control problems. In this paper we overview some models derived from the observation of real ants, emphasizing the role played by stigmergy as distributed communication paradigm, and we show how these models have inspired a number of novel algorithms for the solution of distributed optimization and distributed control problems.},

This paper proposes to get inspiration from the insect navigational strategies to design a celestial compass based on the linear polarization of ultraviolet (UV) skylight. This bio- inspired compass uses only two pixels to determine the solar meridian direction angle. It consists of two UV-light photo-sensors topped with linear polarizers arranged orthogonally to each other as it was observed in insects' Dorsal Rim Area. The compass is embedded on our ant-inspired hexapod walking robot called Hexabot. The performances of the celestial compass under various weather and UV conditions have been investigated. Once embedded onto the robot, the sensor was first used to compensate for yaw random disturbances. We then used the compass to maintain Hexabot's heading direction constant in a straight-forward walking task over a flat terrain while being perturbated in yaw by its walking behaviour. Experiments under various meteorological conditions provided steady state heading direction errors from 0.3\textdegree{} (clear sky) to 1.9\textdegree{} (overcast sky). These results suggest interesting precision and reliability to make this new optical compass suitable for autonomous field robotics navigation tasks.},

  abstract = {Despite their miniature brains insects, such as flies, bees and wasps, are able to navigate by highly aerobatic flight maneuvers in cluttered environments. They rely on spatial information that is contained in the retinal motion patterns induced on the eyes while moving around (`optic flow') to accomplish their extraordinary performance. Thereby, they employ an active flight and gaze strategy that separates rapid saccade-like turns from translatory flight phases where the gaze direction is kept largely constant. This behavioral strategy facilitates the processing of environmental information, because information about the distance of the animal to objects in the environment is only contained in the optic flow generated by translatory motion. However, motion detectors as are widespread in biological systems do not represent veridically the velocity of the optic flow vectors, but also reflect textural information about the environment. This characteristic has often been regarded as a deficiency of a biological motion detection mechanism. In contrast, we conclude from analyses challenging insect movement detectors with image flow as generated during translatory locomotion through cluttered natural environments that this mechanism represents the contours of nearby objects. Contrast borders are a main carrier of functionally relevant object information in artificial and natural sceneries. The motion detection system thus segregates in a computationally parsimonious way the environment into behaviorally relevant nearby objects and \textendash{} in many behavioral contexts \textendash{} less relevant distant structures. Hence, by making use of an active flight and gaze strategy, insects are capable of performing extraordinarily well even with a computationally simple motion detection mechanism.},

  abstract = {There is a growing demand for robust and accurate positioning information for various applications, including the self-driving car industry. Such applications rely mainly on the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), including the Global Positioning System (GPS). However, GPS positioning accuracy relies on several factors, such as satellite geometry, receiver architecture, and navigation environment, to name a few. In urban canyons in which there is a significant probability of signal blockage of one or more satellites and/or interference, the positioning accuracy of scalar-based GPS receivers drastically deteriorates. On the other hand, vector-based GPS receivers exhibit some immunity to momentary outages and interference. Therefore, it is becoming necessary to consider vector-based GPS receivers for several applications, especially safety-critical applications, including next-generation navigation technologies for autonomous vehicles. This paper investigates a vector-based receiver's performance and compares it to its scalar counterpart in signal degraded conditions. The realistic simulation experiments in this paper are conducted on GPS L1 C/A signals generated using the SpirentTM simulation system to create a fully controlled environment to examine and validate the performance. The results show that the vector tracking system outperforms the scalar tracking in terms of position and velocity estimation accuracy in signal-degraded environments.},

  abstract = {The central complex in the insect brain is a composite of midline neuropils involved in processing sensory cues and mediating behavioural outputs to orchestrate spatial navigation. Despite recent advances, however, the neural mechanisms underlying sensory integration and motor action selections have remained largely elusive. In particular, it is not yet understood how the central complex exploits sensory inputs to realise motor functions associated with spatial navigation. Here we report an in silico interrogation of central complex-mediated spatial navigation with a special emphasis on the ellipsoid body. Based on known connectivity and function, we developed a computational model to test how the local connectome of the central complex can mediate sensorimotor integration to guide different forms of behavioural outputs. Our simulations show integration of multiple sensory sources can be effectively performed in the ellipsoid body. This processed information is used to trigger continuous sequences of action selections resulting in self-motion, obstacle avoidance and the navigation of simulated environments of varying complexity. The motor responses to perceived sensory stimuli can be stored in the neural structure of the central complex to simulate navigation relying on a collective of guidance cues, akin to sensory-driven innate or habitual behaviours. By comparing behaviours under different conditions of accessible sources of input information, we show the simulated insect computes visual inputs and body posture to estimate its position in space. Finally, we tested whether the local connectome of the central complex might also allow the flexibility required to recall an intentional behavioural sequence, among different courses of actions. Our simulations suggest that the central complex can encode combined representations of motor and spatial information to pursue a goal and thus successfully guide orientation behaviour. Together, the observed computational features identify central complex circuitry, and especially the ellipsoid body, as a key neural correlate involved in spatial navigation.},

  abstract = {When insects are flying forward, the image of the ground sweeps backward across their ventral viewfield and forms an ``optic flow,'' which depends on both the groundspeed and the groundheight. To explain how these animals manage to avoid the ground by using this visual motion cue, we suggest that insect navigation hinges on a visual-feedback loop we have called the optic-flow regulator, which controls the vertical lift. To test this idea, we built a micro-helicopter equipped with an optic-flow regulator and a bio-inspired optic-flow sensor. This fly-by-sight micro-robot can perform exacting tasks such as take-off, level flight, and landing. Our control scheme accounts for many hitherto unexplained findings published during the last 70 years on insects' visually guided performances; for example, it accounts for the fact that honeybees descend in a headwind [1], land with a constant slope [2], and drown when travelling over mirror-smooth water [3]. Our control scheme explains how insects manage to fly safely without any of the instruments used onboard aircraft to measure the groundheight, groundspeed, and descent speed. An optic-flow regulator is quite simple in terms of its neural implementation and just as appropriate for insects as it would be for aircraft [4].},

  abstract = {Ants are a globally distributed insect family whose members have adapted to live in a wide range of different environments and ecological niches. Foraging ants everywhere face the recurring challenge of navigating to find food and to bring it back to the nest. More than a century of research has led to the identification of some key navigational strategies, such as compass navigation, path integration and route following. Ants have been shown to rely on visual, olfactory and idiothetic cues for navigational guidance. Here, we summarize recent behavioral work, focusing on how these cues are learned and stored as well as how different navigational cues are integrated, often between strategies and even across sensory modalities. Information can also be communicated between different navigational routines. In this way, a shared toolkit of fundamental navigational strategies can lead to substantial flexibility in behavioral outcomes. This allows individual ants to tune their behavioral repertoire to different tasks (e.g. foraging, homing), lifestyles (e.g. diurnal, nocturnal), or environments, depending on the availability and reliability of different guidance cues. We also review recent anatomical and physiological studies in ants and other insects that have started to reveal neural correlates for specific navigational strategies, and which may provide the beginnings of a truly mechanistic understanding of navigation behavior.},

  abstract = {The analysis of animal movement is a large and continuously growing field of research. Detailed knowledge about movement strategies is of crucial importance for understanding eco-evolutionary dynamics at all scales \textendash{} from individuals to (meta-)populations. This and the availability of detailed movement and dispersal data motivated Nathan and colleagues to published their much appreciated call to base movement ecology on a more thorough mechanistic basis. So far, most movement models are based on random walks. However, even if a random walk might describe real movement patterns acceptably well, there is no reason to assume that animals move randomly. Therefore, mechanistic models of foraging strategies should be based on information use and memory in order to increase our understanding of the processes that lead to animal movement decisions. We present a mechanistic movement model of an animal with a limited perceptual range and basic information storage capacities. This `spatially informed forager' constructs an internal map of its environment by using perception, memory and learned or evolutionarily acquired assumptions about landscape attributes. We analyse resulting movement patterns and search efficiencies and compare them to area restricted search strategies (ARS) and biased correlated random walks (BCRW) of omniscient individuals. We show that, in spite of their limited perceptual range, spatially informed individuals boost their foraging success and may perform much better than the best ARS. The construction of an internal map and the use of spatial information results in the emergence of a highly correlated walk between patches and a rather systematic search within resource clusters. Furthermore, the resulting movement patterns may include foray search behaviour. Our work highlights the strength of mechanistic modelling approaches and sets the stage for the development of more sophisticated models of memory use for movement decisions and dispersal.},

This is primarily due to the requirements of some transportation applications where shortest paths need to be quickly identified either because an immediate response is required (e.g., in-vehicle route guidance systems) or because the shortest paths need to be recalculated repeatedly (e.g., vehicle routing and scheduling). For this reason a number of heuristic approaches have been advocated for decreasing the computation time of the shortest path algorithm. This paper presents a survey review of various heuristic shortest path algorithms that have been developed in the past. The goal is to identify the main features of different heuristic strategies, develop a unifying classification framework, and summarize relevant computational experience.},

  abstract = {Humans have long marveled at the ability of animals to navigate swiftly, accurately, and across long distances. Many mechanisms have been proposed for how animals acquire, store, and retrace learned routes, yet many of these hypotheses appear incongruent with behavioral observations and the animals' neural constraints. The ``Navigation by Scene Familiarity Hypothesis'' proposed originally for insect navigation offers an elegantly simple solution for retracing previously experienced routes without the need for complex neural architectures and memory retrieval mechanisms. This hypothesis proposes that an animal can return to a target location by simply moving toward the most familiar scene at any given point. Proof of concept simulations have used computer-generated ant's-eye views of the world, but here we test the ability of scene familiarity algorithms to navigate training routes across satellite images extracted from Google Maps. We find that Google satellite images are so rich in visual information that familiarity algorithms can be used to retrace even tortuous routes with low-resolution sensors. We discuss the implications of these findings not only for animal navigation but also for the potential development of visual augmentation systems and robot guidance algorithms.},

Although suitable for a variety of indoor and outdoor environments, the LiDAR compass is especially useful for embedded and real-time applications requiring low computational overhead. For example, when combined with a sensor that can measure translation (e.g., wheel encoders) the LiDAR compass can be used to yield accurate, lightweight, and very easily implementable localization that requires no prior mapping phase. The utility of using the LiDAR compass as part of a localization algorithm was tested on a widely-available open-source data set, an indoor environment, and a larger-scale outdoor environment. In all cases, it was shown that the growth in heading error was bounded, which significantly reduced the position error to less than 1\% of the distance travelled.},

Shortest paths do not always guarantee the minimum energy consumption of mobile robots. Moreover, they are not always feasible due to climbing constraints of mobile robots, especially on steep terrains. We utilize a heuristic search algorithm to find energy-optimal paths on hilly terrains using an established energy-cost model for mobile robots. The terrains are represented using grid-based elevation maps. Similar to A*-like heuristic search algorithms, the energy-cost of traversing through a given location of the map depends on a heuristic energy-cost estimation from that particular location to the goal. Using zigzag-like path patterns, the proposed heuristic function can estimate heuristic energy-costs on steep terrains that cannot be estimated using traditional methods. We proved that the proposed heuristic energy-cost function is both admissible and consistent. Therefore, the proposed path planner can always find feasible energy-optimal paths on any given terrain without node revisits, provided that such paths exist. Results of tests on real-world terrain models presented in this paper demonstrate the promising computational performance of the proposed path planner in finding energy-efficient paths.},

On one hand, algorithms such as topological sorting are able to find good orderings but their overhead is usually high. On the other hand, shortest path methods, such as Dijkstra's algorithm which is based on priority queues, have been applied successfully to the solution of deterministic shortest-path Markov decision processes.

Several ideas have been proposed to overcome the complex nature of this NP-Complete problem. Ant Colony Optimization algorithms are heuristic methods that have been successfully used to deal with this kind of problems. This paper presents a novel proposal to solve the problem of path planning for mobile robots based on Simple Ant Colony Optimization Meta-Heuristic (SACO-MH). The new method was named SACOdm, where d stands for distance and m for memory. In SACOdm, the decision making process is influenced by the existing distance between the source and target nodes; moreover the ants can remember the visited nodes. The new added features give a speed up around 10 in many cases. The selection of the optimal path relies in the criterion of a Fuzzy Inference System, which is adjusted using a Simple Tuning Algorithm. The path planner application has two operating modes, one is for virtual environments, and the second one works with a real mobile robot using wireless communication. Both operating modes are global planners for plain terrain and support static and dynamic obstacle avoidance.},

We used reverse-correlation to fit parameters to this model; the parameterized model predicted larvae's responses to novel stimulus patterns.

  abstract = {Real-life navigation takes place in large natural environments that are complex and multiscaled. There is a fundamental gap between large-scale navigation and typical laboratory studies of the neurobiology of navigation, in which animals navigate in small boxes. This is a gap in spatial scales, in the richness of sensory information available, and in the techniques used and models proposed for describing small-scale versus large-scale navigation.Spatial cells in the mammalian hippocampal formation include place cells, grid cells, head-direction cells and border (boundary) cells. It is unknown whether and how these neurons contribute to natural navigation on scales beyond a few meters.Bats are excellent animal models for studying spatial cognition, because they are superb navigators, and possess multiple excellent sensory systems, including vision, olfaction and echolocation (biosonar). Bat echolocation is an active-sensing system with high accuracy and dynamic flexibility, which bears surprising similarities to rat whisking and sniffing, with the benefit that bat biosonar can be analysed quantitatively by using the mathematical theory of sonar.Large-scale navigation is likely to be dominated by incoming sensory information rather than by self-motion cues (path integration). Two prominent sensory-based models of place fields, the boundary vector cell (BVC) model and the view-based model, both predict that sensory resolution determines the spatial resolution of place cells.The multiscale character of natural habitats, from small rat burrows and bat caves to large kilometre-scale trajectories, suggests that neural spatial representation by place cells should adapt to this multiscale structure. Three phenomena described in the literature could serve as mechanisms for such multiscale representation: these include the dorsoventral gradient of place-field size in the hippocampus and dorsoventral gradient of grid-spacing in the medial entorhinal cortex, the dynamic adjustment of place-field size to environmental dimensions, and the enhanced precision of spatial representation using population coding.Theoretical models suggested several ways to bridge the gap between spatial representations for 1-m boxes used in laboratory experiments, versus kilometre-scale natural environments. Models of place cells proposed that place fields could rescale according to environmental size, or that place cells can exhibit dozens or hundreds of place fields per neuron; whereas for grid cells, models proposed a combinatorial grid code that could represent simultaneously both small-scale and large geographical environments.Future directions include the need to understand which of these theoretical models best captures the actual neural basis of large-scale navigation, as well as the need to elucidate the neural mechanisms of route planning, re-orienting after losing one's path, and how different maps are stitched together. To answer these questions would require electrophysiological recordings from the hippocampal formation of animals navigating in large-scale, complex naturalistic environments.},

Here the power of optogenetics to engineer proteins as light-responsive switches has been used to control the balance between solubility and aggregation for LOV2-WH1, a chimera between the plant blue light-responsive domain LOV2 and the bacterial prion-like protein RepA-WH1. These proteins were first linked by fusing, as a continuous {$\alpha$}-helix, the Cterminal photo-transducer J{$\alpha$} helix in LOV2 with the N-terminal domain-closure {$\alpha$}1 helix in RepA-WH1, and then improved for light-responsiveness by including mutations in the J{$\alpha$} moiety. In the darkness and in a crowded solution in vitro, LOV2-WH1 nucleates the irreversible assembly of amyloid fibres into a hydrogel. However, under blue light illumination LOV2-WH1 assembles as soluble oligomers. When expressed in Escherichia coli, LOV2-WH1 forms in the darkness large intracellular amyloid inclusions compatible with bacterial proliferation. Strikingly, under blue light LOV2-WH1 aggregates decrease in size while they become detrimental for bacterial growth. LOV2-WH1 optogenetics governs the assembly of mutually exclusive inert amyloid fibres or cytotoxic oligomers, thus enabling the navigation of the conformational landscape of protein amyloidogenesis to generate potential photo-activated anti-bacterial devices (optobiotics).},

When mice had limited prior experience of source locations, their~search behavior was consistent with~a gradient ascent algorithm that utilized directional cues in the~plume to navigate to the odor source. Gradient climbing was effective because the arena size allowed animals to conduct their search mainly within the odor plume, with frequent odor contacts.~With increased experience, mice shifted their strategy from this flexible, sensory-driven search behavior to a more efficient and stereotyped foraging approach that varied little in response to odor plumes. This study demonstrates that mice use prior knowledge to adaptively balance flexibility and efficiency during complex behavior guided by dynamic natural stimuli.},

Fundamental to the reliability of this process is the use of a neural compass based on external celestial cues. Here we examine how such compass information could be reliably computed by the insect brain, given realistic constraints on the sky polarisation pattern and the insect eye sensor array. By processing the degree of polarisation in different directions for different parts of the sky, our model can directly estimate the solar azimuth and also infer the confidence of the estimate. We introduce a method to correct for tilting of the sensor array, as might be caused by travel over uneven terrain. We also show that the confidence can be used to approximate the change in sun position over time, allowing the compass to remain fixed with respect to `true north' during long excursions. We demonstrate that the compass is robust to disturbances and can be effectively used as input to an existing neural model of insect path integration. We discuss the plausibility of our model to be mapped to known neural circuits, and to be implemented for robot navigation.},

  abstract = {Despite their small size, insect brains are able to produce robust and efficient navigation in complex environments. Specifically in social insects, such as ants and bees, these navigational capabilities are guided by orientation directing vectors generated by a process called path integration. During this process, they integrate compass and odometric cues to estimate their current location as a vector, called the home vector for guiding them back home on a straight path. They further acquire and retrieve path integration-based vector memories globally to the nest or based on visual landmarks. Although existing computational models reproduced similar behaviors, a neurocomputational model of vector navigation including the acquisition of vector representations has not been described before. Here we present a model of neural mechanisms in a modular closed-loop control - enabling vector navigation in artificial agents. The model consists of a path integration mechanism, reward-modulated global learning, random search, and action selection. The path integration mechanism integrates compass and odometric cues to compute a vectorial representation of the agent's current location as neural activity patterns in circular arrays. A reward-modulated learning rule enables the acquisition of vector memories by associating the local food reward with the path integration state. A motor output is computed based on the combination of vector memories and random exploration. In simulation, we show that the neural mechanisms enable robust homing and localization, even in the presence of external sensory noise. The proposed learning rules lead to goal-directed navigation and route formation performed under realistic conditions. Consequently, we provide a novel approach for vector learning and navigation in a simulated, situated agent linking behavioral observations to their possible underlying neural substrates.},

  author = {{Gonz{\'a}lez-Ba{\~n}os}, H{\'e}ctor H and Latombe, Jean-Claude},
  pages = {20},
  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate safe and efficient map-building strategies for a mobile robot with imperfect control and sensing. In the implementation, a robot equipped with a range sensor builds a polygonal map (layout) of a previously unknown indoor environment. The robot explores the environment and builds the map concurrently by patching together the local models acquired by the sensor into a global map. A well-studied and related problem is the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem, where the goal is to integrate the information collected during navigation into the most accurate map possible. However, SLAM does not address the sensorplacement portion of the map-building task. That is, given the map built so far, where should the robot go next? This is the main question addressed in this paper. Concretely, an algorithm is proposed to guide the robot through a series of ``good'' positions, where ``good'' refers to the expected amount and quality of the information that will be revealed at each new location. This is similar to the nextbest-view (NBV) problem studied in computer vision and graphics. However, in mobile robotics the problem is complicated by several issues, two of which are particularly crucial. One is to achieve safe navigation despite an incomplete knowledge of the environment and sensor limitations (e.g., in range and incidence). The other issue is the need to ensure sufficient overlap between each new local model and the current map, in order to allow registration of successive views under positioning uncertainties inherent to mobile robots. To address both issues in a coherent framework, in this paper we introduce the concept of a safe region, defined as the largest region that is guaranteed to be free of obstacles given the sensor readings made so far. The construction of a safe region takes sensor limitations into account. In this paper we also describe an NBV algorithm that uses the safe-region concept to select the next robot position at each step.},

Here we describe a set of clockwise- and anticlockwise-shifting neurons in the Drosophila central complex whose wiring and physiology provide a means to rotate an angular heading estimate based on the fly's angular velocity. We show that each class of shifting neurons exists in two subtypes, with spatiotemporal activity profiles that suggest different roles for each subtype at the start and end of tethered-walking turns. Shifting neurons are required for the heading system to properly track the fly's heading in the dark, and stimulation of these neurons induces predictable shifts in the heading signal. The central features of this biological circuit are analogous to those of computational models proposed for head-direction cells in rodents and may shed light on how neural systems, in general, perform integration.},

Navigation based on processing some analog features of an RFID signal is a promising alternative to different types of navigation methods in the state of the art. The main idea is to exploit the ability of a mobile robot to navigate a priori unknown environments without a vision system and without building an approximate map of the robot workspace, as is the case in most other navigation algorithms. This paper discusses how this is achieved by placing RFID tags in the 3-D space so that the lines linking their projections on the ground define the ldquofree waysrdquo along which the robot can (or is desired to) move. The suggested algorithm is capable of reaching a target point in its a priori unknown workspace, as well as tracking a desired trajectory with a high precision. The proposed solution offers a modular, computationally efficient, and cost-effective alternative to other navigation techniques for a large number of mobile robot applications, particularly for service robots, such as, for instance, in large offices and assembly lines. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated through a number of computer simulations considering testbeds of various complexities.},

We define these scales so that they describe movement behavior both at short scales (through the velocity autocorrelation function) and at long scales (through the diffusion coefficient). We derive these scales for two types of commonly used movement models: the discrete-step correlated random walk, with either constant or random step intervals, and the continuous-time correlated velocity model. For a given set of characteristic scales, the models produce very similar trajectories and encounter rates between moving searchers and stationary targets. Thus, we argue that characteristic scales provide a unifying currency that can be used to parameterize a wide range of ecological phenomena related to movement.},

Grid cells are important information source of place cells. The supervised learning and unsupervised learning models can be used to simulate the generation of place cells from grid cell inputs. However, the existing models preset the firing characteristics of grid cell. In this paper, we propose a united generation model of grid cells and place cells. First, the visual place cells with nonuniform distribution generate the visual grid cells with regional firing field through feedforward network. Second, the visual grid cells and the self-motion information generate the united grid cells whose firing fields extend to the whole space through genetic algorithm. Finally, the visual place cells and the united grid cells generate the united place cells with uniform distribution through supervised fuzzy adaptive resonance theory (ART) network. Simulation results show that this model has stronger environmental adaptability and can provide reference for the research on spatial representation model and brain-inspired navigation mechanism of intelligent agents under the condition of nonuniform environmental information.},

Although experimental evidence has yet to be provided, this concept seems biologically plausible and not limited to the navigation problem. Neural chains are able to represent variables by activity patterns with high accuracy and temporal stability. Moreover, they are able to integrate incremental signals with high precision. Cyclical chains of neurons show superior performance as soon as cyclical variables are to be represented and integrated. Finally, representation of cyclical variables by travelling activity peaks allows simple approximations of goniometric functions as they are used in path integration systems.},

  abstract = {Continuously monitoring its position in space relative to a goal is one of the most essential tasks for an animal that moves through its environment. Species as diverse as rats, bees, and crabs achieve this by integrating all changes of direction with the distance covered during their foraging trips, a process called path integration. They generate an estimate of their current position relative to a starting point, enabling a straight-line return, following what is known as a home vector. While in theory path integration always leads the animal precisely back home, in the real world noise limits the usefulness of this strategy when operating in isolation. Noise results from stochastic processes in the nervous system and from unreliable sensory information, particularly when obtaining heading estimates. Path integration, during which angular self-motion provides the sole input for encoding heading (idiothetic path integration), results in accumulating errors that render this strategy useless over long distances. In contrast, when using an external compass this limitation is avoided (allothetic path integration). Many navigating insects indeed rely on external compass cues for estimating body orientation, whereas they obtain distance information by integration of steps or optic-flow-based speed signals. In the insect brain, a region called the central complex plays a key role for path integration. Not only does the central complex house a ring-attractor network that encodes head directions, neurons responding to optic flow also converge with this circuit. A neural substrate for integrating direction and distance into a memorized home vector has therefore been proposed in the central complex. We discuss how behavioral data and the theoretical framework of path integration can be aligned with these neural data.},

  abstract = {Oriented behaviour is present in almost all animals, indicating that it is an ancient feature that has emerged from animal brains hundreds of millions of years ago. Although many complex navigation strategies have been described, each strategy can be broken down into a series of elementary navigational decisions. In each moment in time, an animal has to compare its current heading with its desired direction and compensate for any mismatch by producing a steering response either to the right or to the left. Different from reflex-driven movements, target-directed navigation is not only initiated in response to sensory input, but also takes into account previous experience and motivational state. Once a series of elementary decisions are chained together to form one of many coherent navigation strategies, the animal can pursue a navigational target, e.g. a food source, a nest entrance or a constant flight direction during migrations. Insects show a great variety of complex navigation behaviours and, owing to their small brains, the pursuit of the neural circuits controlling navigation has made substantial progress over the last years. A brain region as ancient as insects themselves, called the central complex, has emerged as the likely navigation centre of the brain. Research across many species has shown that the central complex contains the circuitry that might comprise the neural substrate of elementary navigational decisions. Although this region is also involved in a wide range of other functions, we hypothesize in this Review that its role in mediating the animal's next move during target-directed behaviour is its ancestral function, around which other functions have been layered over the course of evolution.},

  abstract = {Computer simulations play an important role in testing hypotheses, integrating knowledge, and providing predictions of neural circuit functions. While considerable effort has been dedicated into simulating primate or rodent brains, the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is becoming a promising model animal in computational neuroscience for its small brain size, complex cognitive behavior, and abundancy of data available from genes to circuits. Moreover, several Drosophila connectome projects have generated a large number of neuronal images that account for a significant portion of the brain, making a systematic investigation of the whole brain circuit possible. Supported by FlyCircuit (http://www.flycircuit.tw), one of the largest Drosophila neuron image databases, we began a long-term project with the goal to construct a whole-brain spiking network model of the Drosophila brain. In this paper, we report the outcome of the first phase of the project. We developed the Flysim platform, which 1) identifies the polarity of each neuron arbor, 2) predicts connections between neurons, 3) translates morphology data from the database into physiology parameters for computational modeling, 4) reconstructs a brain-wide network model, which consists of 20,089 neurons and 1,044,020 synapses, and 5) performs computer simulations of the resting state. We compared the reconstructed brain network with a randomized brain network by shuffling the connections of each neuron. We found that the reconstructed brain can be easily stabilized by implementing synaptic short-term depression, while the randomized one exhibited seizure-like firing activity under the same treatment. Furthermore, the reconstructed Drosophila brain was structurally and dynamically more diverse than the randomized one and exhibited both Poisson-like and patterned firing activities. Despite being at its early stage of development, this single-cell level brain model allows us to study some of the fundamental properties of neural networks including network balance, critical behavior, long-term stability, and plasticity.},

  abstract = {E. coli cells swim in aqueous environment in a random walk of alternating runs and tumbles. The diffusion characteristics of this random walk remains unclear. Here, by tracking the swimming of wildtype cells in a 3d homogeneous environment, we found that their trajectories are super diffusive, consistent with L\'evy walk behavior. For comparison, we tracked the swimming of mutant cells that lack the chemotaxis signaling noise (the steady-state fluctuation of the concentration of the chemotaxis response regulator CheY-P), and found that their trajectories are normal diffusive. Therefore, wildtype E. coli cells explore the environment by L\'evy walk, which originates from the chemotaxis signaling noise. This L\'evy walk pattern enhances their efficiency in environmental exploration. Importance E. coli cells explore the environment in a random walk of alternating runs and tumbles. By tracking the 3d trajectories of E. coli cells in aqueous environment, we find that their trajectories are super diffusive, with a power-law shape for the distribution of run lengths, which is characteristics of L\'evy walk. We further show that this L\'evy walk behavior is due to the random fluctuation of the output level of the bacterial chemotaxis pathway, and it enhances the efficiency of the bacteria in exploring the environment.},

The estimation system accuracy associated with the modified estimator is shown to be essentially the same as that of the generalized partitioned Kalman estimator. Considering that the sensor error random rates assumed in the example are on the order of 5 to 10 times greater than normally associated with contemporary strapdown systems, it may be inferred that inertial navigation systems possessing more typical sensor error random growth characteristics should be amenable to a decoupled estimator approach in a broad spectrum of aided-navigation system applications. This should also be true in a variety of other applications in which the bias vector experiences only limited random variation.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Intelligent algorithm acts as one of the most important solutions to path planning problem. In order to solve the problems of poor real-time and low accuracy of the heuristic optimization algorithm in 3D path planning, this paper proposes a novel heuristic intelligent algorithm derived from the Beetle Antennae Search (BAS) algorithm. The algorithm proposed in this paper has the advantages of wide search range and high search accuracy, and can still maintain a low time complexity when multiple mechanisms are introduced. This paper combines the BAS algorithm with three non-trivial mechanisms proposed to solve the problems of low search efficiency and poor convergence accuracy in 3D path planning. The algorithm contains three non-trivial mechanisms, including local fast search, aco initial path generation, and searching information orientation. At first, local fast search mechanism presents a specific bounded area and add fast iterative exploration to speed up the convergence of path finding. Then aco initial path generation mechanism is initialized by Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) as a pruning basis. The initialization of the ACO algorithm can quickly obtain an effective path. Using the exploration trend of this path, the algorithm can quickly obtain a locally optimal path. Thirdly, searching information orientation mechanism is employed for BAS algorithm to guarantee the stability of the path finding, thereby avoiding blind exploration and reducing wasted computing resources. Simulation results show that the algorithm proposed in this paper has higher search accuracy and exploration speed than other intelligent algorithms, and improves the adaptability of the path planning algorithms in different environments. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified in simulation.},

However, our ability to analyze and model such data has lagged behind the sophisticated collection methods. We review problems with current methods and suggest a more powerful and flexible approach, state-space modeling, and we illustrate how these models can be posed in a meta-analytic framework so that information from individual trajectories may be combined optimally. State-space models enable us to deal with the complexity of modeling animals interacting with their environment but, unlike other methods, they allow simultaneous estimation of measurement error and process noise that are inherent in animal-trajectory data. A Bayesian framework allows us to incorporate important prior information when available and also allows meta-analytic techniques to be incorporated in a straightforward fashion. Meta-analysis enables both individual and broader-level inference from observations of multiple individual pathways. Our approach is powerful because it allows researchers to test hypotheses regarding animal movement, to connect theoretical models to data, and to use modern likelihood-based estimation techniques, all under a single statistical framework.},

Here, I show how a joint estimation approach that assumes individuals share identical movement parameters can lead to improved inference of behavioural states associated with different movement processes. I use simulated movement paths with known behavioural states to compare estimation error between nonhierarchical and joint estimation formulations of an otherwise identical state-space model. Behavioural state estimation error was strongly affected by the degree of similarity between movement patterns characterising the behavioural states, with less error when movements were strongly dissimilar between states. The joint estimation model improved behavioural state estimation relative to the nonhierarchical model for simulated data with heavy-tailed Argos location errors. When applied to Argos telemetry datasets from 10 Weddell seals, the nonhierarchical model estimated highly uncertain behavioural state switching probabilities for most individuals whereas the joint estimation model yielded substantially less uncertainty. The joint estimation model better resolved the behavioural state sequences across all seals. Hierarchical or joint estimation models should be the preferred choice for estimating behavioural states from animal movement data, especially when location data are error-prone.},

It is increasingly being recognised that applications of intelligent bio-inspired algorithms are necessary for addressing highly complex problems to provide working solutions in time, especially with dynamic problem definitions, fluctuations in constraints, incomplete or imperfect information and limited computation capacity. More and more such intelligent algorithms are thus being explored for solving different complex problems. While some studies are exploring the application of these algorithms in a novel context, other studies are incrementally improving the algorithm itself. However, the fast growth in the domain makes researchers unaware of the progresses across different approaches and hence awareness across algorithms is increasingly reducing, due to which the literature on bio-inspired computing is skewed towards few algorithms only (like neural networks, genetic algorithms, particle swarm and ant colony optimization). To address this concern, we identify the popularly used algorithms within the domain of bio-inspired algorithms and discuss their principles, developments and scope of application. Specifically, we have discussed the neural networks, genetic algorithm, particle swarm, ant colony optimization, artificial bee colony, bacterial foraging, cuckoo search, firefly, leaping frog, bat algorithm, flower pollination and artificial plant optimization algorithm. Further objectives which could be addressed by these twelve algorithms have also be identified and discussed. This review would pave the path for future studies to choose algorithms based on fitment. We have also identified other bio-inspired algorithms, where there are a lot of scope in theory development and applications, due to the absence of significant literature.},

  abstract = {The humanoid robot is widely used because of its ability to imitate human actions. The selection of navigational techniques is of prime importance because the quality of the opted technique directly affects the success of output. In this paper, the hybridization of the Dynamic Window Approach (DWA) and the Teaching\textendash Learning-Based Optimization (TLBO) technique and its implementation on the NAO humanoid robot for navigation have been presented. The input is based on the location of obstacles and the target. The parameters are provided to the DWA technique, which decides the optimum velocity. The intermediate result is feed to the TLBO technique, which operates based on the teacher phase and the learner phase. This hybridization provides an optimum angle to take a turn and avoids the obstacles while moving towards the target. The current article concentrates on implementing hybridized techniques in static and dynamic terrains. Single NAO and some random obstacles are chosen for static navigation. For dynamic terrains, multiple NAOs and some static obstacles are considered. In this case, one humanoid robot acts as a dynamic obstacle to another. In the dynamic terrain, there is a possibility of inter-collision amongst NAOs. To avoid inter-collision, a Petri-Net controller has been designed and implemented in all NAOs. Simulation and experimental results on humanoid NAOs demonstrate target attainment with collision-free optimal paths. Experimental and simulated results of the proposed technique present an acceptable relation under 5 \% and 6 \% for a single robot and multiple robots, respectively. The proposed technique has been compared with previously developed techniques in complex, danger and dynamic terrains. In comparison with previously developed techniques, it is evident that the proposed technique is robust and efficient for the path planning of humanoid robots.},

The most popular of these models (due to Cartwright and Collett), proposes that honey bees navigate via a static image comparison process wherein motion vectors towards a target are calculated based on the di erences between an image currently projected on a bee's retina and a remembered snapshot \{ taken from a similar place in the environment.

Synthesizing these traditionally plant-derived compounds in genetically modified yeast cells introduces the possibility of significantly reducing the total time and resources required for their production, and in turn, allows these valuable compounds to become cheaper and more readily available. Most biosynthesis pathways used in metabolic engineering applications have been discovered manually, requiring a tedious search of existing literature and metabolic databases. However, the recent rapid development of available metabolic information has enabled the development of automated approaches for identifying novel pathways. Computer-assisted pathfinding has the potential to save biochemists time in the initial discovery steps of metabolic engineering. In this paper, we review the parameters and heuristics used to guide the search in recent pathfinding algorithms. These parameters and heuristics capture information on the metabolic network structure, compound structures, reaction features, and organism-specificity of pathways. No one metabolic pathfinding algorithm or search parameter stands out as the best to use broadly for solving the pathfinding problem, as each method and parameter has its own strengths and shortcomings. As assisted pathfinding approaches continue to become more sophisticated, the development of better methods for visualizing pathway results and integrating these results into existing metabolic engineering practices is also important for encouraging wider use of these pathfinding methods.},

Many animals use a combination of different strategies to return to significant locations in their environment. For example, the desert ant Cataglyphis is able to explore its desert habitat for hundreds of meters while foraging and return back to its nest precisely and on a straight line. The three main strategies that Cataglyphis is using to accomplish this task are path integration, visual piloting and systematic search. In this study, we use a synthetic methodology to gain additional insights into the navigation behavior of Cataglyphis. Inspired by the insect's navigation system we have developed mechanisms for path integration and visual piloting that were successfully employed on the mobile robot Sahabot 2. On the one hand, the results obtained from these experiments provide support for the underlying biological models. On the other hand, by taking the parsimonious navigation strategies of insects as a guideline, computationally cheap navigation methods for mobile robots are derived from the insights gained in the experiments.},

  abstract = {In robotics, grid maps are often used for solving tasks like collision checking, path planning, and localization. Many approaches to these problems use Euclidean distance maps (DMs), generalized Voronoi diagrams (GVDs), or configuration space (c-space) maps. A key challenge for their application in dynamic environments is the efficient update after potential changes due to moving obstacles or when mapping a previously unknown area. To this end, this paper presents novel algorithms that perform incremental updates that only visit cells affected by changes. Furthermore, we propose incremental update algorithms for DMs and GVDs in the configuration space of non-circular robots. These approaches can be used to implement highly efficient collision checking and holonomic path planning for these platforms. Our c-space representations benefit from parallelization on multi-core CPUs and can also be integrated with other state-of-the-art path planners such as rapidly-exploring random trees. In various experiments using real-world data we show that our update strategies for DMs and GVDs require substantially less cell visits and computation time compared to previous approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our GVD algorithm deals better with non-convex structures, such as indoor areas. All our algorithms consider actual Euclidean distances rather than grid steps and are easy to implement. An open source implementation is available online.},

In this paper, we apply the distance information of the surrounding environment in a landmark navigation model. We mount a depth sensor on a mobile robot, in order to obtain omnidirectional distance information. The surrounding environment is represented as a circular form of landmark vectors, which forms a snapshot. The depth snapshots at the current position and the target position are compared to determine the homing direction, inspired by the snapshot model. Here, we suggest a holistic view of panoramic depth information for homing navigation where each sample point is taken as a landmark. The results are shown in a vector map of homing vectors. The performance of the suggested method is evaluated based on the angular errors and the homing success rate. Omnidirectional depth information about the surrounding environment can be a promising source of landmark homing navigation. We demonstrate the results that a holistic approach with omnidirectional depth information shows effective homing navigation.},

The neural circuit of the Central Complex (a brain area that receives compass and optic flow information) forms a plausible substrate for these behaviours. A recent model, grounded in neurophysiological and neuroanatomical data, can account for PI during outbound exploratory routes and the control of steering to return home. Here, we show that minor, hypothetical but neurally plausible, extensions of this model can additionally explain how insects could store and recall PI vectors to follow food-ward paths, take shortcuts, search at the feeder and re-calibrate their vector-memories with experience. In addition, a simple assumption about how one of multiple vector-memories might be chosen at any point in time can produce the development and maintenance of efficient routes between multiple locations, as observed in bees. The central complex circuitry is therefore well-suited to allow for a rich vector-based navigational repertoire.},

Therefore, understanding the link between neurons and behaviour is a multi-level problem, which can be achieved when considering Marr's three levels of understanding: behaviour, computation, and neural implementation. Rather than establishing direct links between neurons and behaviour, the matter boils down to understanding two transitions: the link between neurons and brain computation on one hand, and the link between brain computations and behaviour on the other hand. The field of insect navigation illustrates well the power of such two-sided endeavour. We provide here examples revealing that each transition requires its own approach with its own intrinsic difficulties, and show how modelling can help us reach the desired multi-level understanding.},

Interactions between these proposed factors may be responsible for the colony losses reported worldwide in recent years. In the present study, the effects of a honey bee virus, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), on the foraging behaviors and homing ability of European honey bees (Apis mellifera L.) were investigated based on proboscis extension response (PER) assays and radio frequency identification (RFID) systems. The pollen forager honey bees originated from colonies that had no detectable level of honey bee viruses and were manually inoculated with IAPV to induce the viral infection. The results showed that IAPV-inoculated honey bees were more responsive to low sucrose solutions compared to that of non-infected foragers. After two days of infection, around 107 copies of IAPV were detected in the heads of these honey bees. The homing ability of IAPV-infected foragers was depressed significantly in comparison to the homing ability of uninfected foragers. The data provided evidence that IAPV infection in the heads may enable the virus to disorder foraging roles of honey bees and to interfere with brain functions that are responsible for learning, navigation, and orientation in the honey bees, thus, making honey bees have a lower response threshold to sucrose and lose their way back to the hive.},

Traditional navigation technique takes advantage of the accurate positioning of DGPS and high-definition (HD) map to facilitate path tracking. However, HD map occupies large storage space due to its extensive information on the detailed structure of the environment, which is extremely costly to deploy onto invehicle computing devices. This work proposes a low-cost vector map based navigation framework. By recording the vector map offline, the framework initializes an optimal global route by giving any starting and ending position on the map. During runtime, the computer filters the real-time positioning data from DGPS and tracks the planned path according to geometric rules. Besides, when the Lidar/vision subsystem detects any obstacles, the method dynamically adjusts the local path to realize obstacle avoidance. Demonstrated on an AV testing platform, the proposed method calculates the angle of the steering wheel and transmits the actual commands through CAN bus interface.},

  abstract = {Some female moths attract male moths by emitting series of pulses of pheromone filaments propagating downwind. The turbulent nature of the wind creates a complex flow environment, and causes the filaments to propagate in the form of patches with varying concentration distributions. Inspired by moth navigation capabilities, we propose a navigation strategy that enables a flier to locate an upwind pulsating odor source in a windy environment using a single threshold-based detection sensor. This optomotor anemotaxis strategy is constructed based on the physical properties of the turbulent flow carrying discrete puffs of odor and does not involve learning, memory, complex decision making or statistical methods. We suggest that in turbulent plumes from a pulsating point source, an instantaneously measurable quantity referred as a ``puff crossing time'', improves the success rate as compared to the navigation strategies based on temporally regular zigzags due to intermittent contact, or an ``internal counter'', that do not use this information. Using computer simulations of fliers navigating in turbulent plumes of the pulsating point source for varying flow parameters such as turbulent intensities, plume meandering and wind gusts, we obtained statistics of navigation paths towards the pheromone sources. We quantified the probability of a successful navigation as well as the flight parameters such as the time spent searching and the total flight time, with respect to different turbulent intensities, meandering or gusts. The concepts learned using this model may help to design odor-based navigation of miniature airborne autonomous vehicles.},

An improved ant colony algorithm is proposed to plan a reasonable collision-free path for each mobile robot of multi-robot system in the decoupled path planning scheme in complicated static environment. The special functions are added into the regular ant colony algorithm to improve the selective strategy. When an ant explores a dead-corner in path searching, a dead-corner table is established and a penalty function is used for the trail intensity updated in order to avoid the path deadlock of mobile robot. A behavior strategy on "first come and first service" is adopted to solve the conflict between moving robots in distributed local navigation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the performance of the planned path, and the individual robots with collision-free can achieve to reach their goal locations by the simple local navigation strategies},

  abstract = {This paper presents a bio-inspired search behavior model for navigating using geomagnetic information in unknown environments. A multi-objective search navigation framework combining random walk movement model and stress evolution algorithm is applied to the navigation. Firstly, motivated by animal geomagnetic navigation behavior, we generalize the bio-inspired navigation process as the convergence of geomagnetic multi-parameter from the present point values to object point values. Then, we adopt a random walk movement model to represent the moving behavior of vehicle. In addition, stress evolution algorithm is used to obtain the appropriate direction, which realizes the convergence of multi-objective function as well as the bio-inspired navigation of vehicle. Finally, simulation results show that the proposed algorithm not only allows the vehicle to navigate efficiently using geomagnetic information without prior map, but also significantly improves the robustness of the navigation performance which could cross abnormal environment. The proposed algorithm offers insights into the research and application of the biologically inspired geomagnetic navigation.},

  abstract = {Development of spiking neural networks (SNNs) controlling mobile robots is one of the modern challenges in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Such networks, being replicas of biological ones, are expected to have a higher computational potential than traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). The key problem is in the design of robust learning algorithms aimed at building a "living computer" on the basis of SNNs. Here, we propose a simple SNN equipped with a Hebbian rule in the form of spike timing dependent plasticity (STDP). The SNN implements associative learning by exploring spatial properties of STDP. We show that a LEGO robot controlled by the SNN can exhibit classical and operant conditioning. Competition of spike-conducting pathways in the SNN plays the fundamental role in establishing associations of neural connections. It replaces the irrelevant associations by new ones in response to a change in stimuli. Thus, the robot gets the ability to relearn when the environment changes. The proposed SNN and the stimulation protocol can be further enhanced and tested in developing neuronal cultures. They also admit the use of memristive devices for hardware implementation.},

According to this perspective, physical reasoning problems are approached by repeatedly simulating relevant aspects of a scenario, with noise, and making judgments based on aggregation over these simulations. In this paper, we describe three core tenets of simulation approaches, theoretical commitments that must be present in order for a simulation approach to be viable. The identification of these tenets threatens the plausibility of simulation as a theory of physical reasoning, because they appear to be incompatible with what we know about cognition more generally. To investigate this apparent contradiction, we describe three experiments involving simple physical judgments and predictions, and argue their results challenge these core predictions of theories of mental simulation.},

The navigation consists of four essential requirements known as perception, localization, cognition and path planning, and motion control in which path planning is the most important and interesting part. The proposed path planning techniques are classified into two main categories: classical methods and heuristic methods. The classical methods consist of cell decomposition, potential field method, subgoal network and road map. The approaches are simple; however, they commonly consume expensive computation and may possibly fail when the robot confronts with uncertainty. This survey concentrates on heuristic-based algorithms in robot path planning which are comprised of neural network, fuzzy logic, nature-inspired algorithms and hybrid algorithms. In addition, potential field method is also considered due to the good results. The strengths and drawbacks of each algorithm are discussed and future outline is provided.},

Such information is required to be able to navigate to goal locations, and is vitally important for any embodied agent, or model thereof, for reaching goals in a spatially extended environment. In this paper, a number of computationally implemented cognitive models of spatial memory are reviewed and compared. Three categories of models are considered: symbolic models, neural network models, and models that are part of a systems-level cognitive architecture. Representative models from each category are described and compared in a number of dimensions along which simulation models can differ (level of modeling, types of representation, structural accuracy, generality and abstraction, environment complexity), including their possible mapping to the underlying neural substrate. Neural mappings are rarely explicated in the context of behaviorally validated models, but they could be useful to cognitive modeling research by providing a new approach for investigating a model's plausibility. Finally, suggested experimental neuroscience methods are described for verifying the biological plausibility of computational cognitive models of spatial memory, and open questions for the field of spatial memory modeling are outlined.},

Three navigation algorithms are compared with a simple gas sensor and with an electronic nose. Their performance in finding an ethanol source in a room with obstacles is evaluated. The first navigation strategy is based on bacteria chemotaxis. The second strategy is based on the male silkworm moth algorithm that is used to search and track a female moth pheromone plume. The last strategy is based on the estimation of odour geometry and gradient tracking. The electronic nose utilized is composed by an array of different and weakly selective metal oxide gas sensors. The odours are identified and quantified by a pattern recognition algorithm based on an artificial neural network.

Consistent with recent findings the model supports navigation using heading direction information, thus precluding the use of global information. We tested our model using a mobile robot performing a foraging task. While foraging for chemical sources in a wind tunnel, the robot memorizes the followed trajectories, using information from landmarks and heading direction accumulators. After foraging, landmark navigation is tested with the odor source turned off. Our results show stability against robot kidnapping and generalization of homing behavior to stable mapless landmark navigation. This demonstrates that allocentric and efficient goal-oriented navigation strategies can be generated by relying on purely local information.},

  abstract = {Recent developments in animal tracking technology have permitted the collection of detailed data on the movement paths of individuals from many species. However, analysis methods for these data have not developed at a similar pace, largely due to a lack of suitable candidate models, coupled with the technical difficulties of fitting such models to data. To facilitate a general modeling framework, we propose that complex movement paths can be conceived as a series of movement strategies among which animals transition as they are affected by changes in their internal and external environment. We synthesize previously existing and novel methodologies to develop a general suite of mechanistic models based on biased and correlated random walks that allow different behavioral states for directed (e.g., migration), exploratory (e.g., dispersal), area-restricted (e.g., foraging), and other types of movement. Using this ``toolbox'' of nested model components, multistate movement models may be custom-built for a wide variety of species and applications. As a unified state-space modeling framework, it allows the simultaneous investigation of numerous hypotheses about animal movement from imperfectly observed data, including time allocations to different movement behavior states, transitions between states, the use of memory or navigation, and strengths of attraction (or repulsion) to specific locations. The inclusion of covariate information permits further investigation of specific hypotheses related to factors driving different types of movement behavior. Using reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to facilitate Bayesian model selection and multi-model inference, we apply the proposed methodology to real data by adapting it to the natural history of the grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) in the North Sea. Although previous grey seal studies tended to focus on correlated movements, we found overwhelming evidence that bias toward haul-out or foraging locations better explained seal movement than did simple or correlated random walks. Posterior model probabilities also provided evidence that seals transition among directed, area-restricted, and exploratory movements associated with haul-out, foraging, and other behaviors. With this intuitive framework for modeling and interpreting animal movement, we believe that the development and application of custom-made movement models will become more accessible to ecologists and non-statisticians.},

  abstract = {Animal movement is essential to our understanding of population dynamics, animal behavior, and the impacts of global change. Coupled with high-resolution biotelemetry data, exciting new inferences about animal movement have been facilitated by various specifications of contemporary models. These approaches differ, but most share common themes. One key distinction is whether the underlying movement process is conceptualized in discrete or continuous time. This is perhaps the greatest source of confusion among practitioners, both in terms of implementation and biological interpretation. In general, animal movement occurs in continuous time but we observe it at fixed discrete-time intervals. Thus, continuous time is conceptually and theoretically appealing, but in practice it is perhaps more intuitive to interpret movement in discrete intervals. With an emphasis on state-space models, we explore the differences and similarities between continuous and discrete versions of mechanistic movement models, establish some common terminology, and indicate under which circumstances one form might be preferred over another. Counter to the overly simplistic view that discrete- and continuous-time conceptualizations are merely different means to the same end, we present novel mathematical results revealing hitherto unappreciated consequences of model formulation on inferences about animal movement. Notably, the speed and direction of movement are intrinsically linked in current continuous-time random walk formulations, and this can have important implications when interpreting animal behavior. We illustrate these concepts in the context of state-space models with multiple movement behavior states using northern fur seal (Callorhinus ursinus) biotelemetry data.},

  abstract = {When data streams are observed without error and at regular time intervals, discrete-time hidden Markov models (HMMs) have become immensely popular for the analysis of animal location and auxiliary biotelemetry data. However, measurement error and temporally irregular data are often pervasive in telemetry studies, particularly in marine systems. While relatively small amounts of missing data that are missing-completely-at-random are not typically problematic in HMMs, temporal irregularity can result in few (if any) observations aligning with the regular time steps required by HMMs. Fitting HMMs that explicitly account for uncertainty attributable to location measurement error, temporally irregular observations, or other forms of missing data typically requires computationally demanding techniques, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Using simulation and a real-world bearded seal (Erignathus barbatus) example, I investigate a practical alternative to incorporating measurement error and temporally irregular observations into HMMs based on multiple imputation of the position process drawn from a single-state continuous-time movement model. This two-stage approach is relatively simple, performed with existing software using efficient maximum likelihood methods, and completely parallelizable. I generally found the approach to perform well across a broad range of simulated measurement error and irregular sampling rates, with latent states and locations reliably recovered in nearly all simulated scenarios. However, high measurement error coupled with low sampling rates often induced bias in both the estimated probability distributions of data streams derived from the imputed position process and the estimated effects of spatial covariates on state transition probabilities. Results from the two-stage analysis of the bearded seal data were similar to a more computationally intensive single-stage MCMC analysis, but the two-stage analysis required much less computation time and no custom model-fitting algorithms. I thus found the two-stage multiple-imputation approach to be promising in terms of its ease of implementation, computation time, and performance. Code for implementing the approach using the R package ``momentuHMM'' is provided.},

  abstract = {We study the problem of computing the optimal value function for a Markov decision process with positive costs. Computing this function quickly and accurately is a basic step in many schemes for deciding how to act in stochastic environments. There are efficient algorithms which compute value functions for special types of MDPs: for deterministic MDPs with S states and A actions, Dijkstra's algorithm runs in time O(AS log S). And, in single-action MDPs (Markov chains), standard linear-algebraic algorithms find the value function in time O(S3), or faster by taking advantage of sparsity or good conditioning. Algorithms for solving general MDPs can take much longer: we are not aware of any speed guarantees better than those for comparably-sized linear programs. We present a family of algorithms which reduce to Dijkstra's algorithm when applied to deterministic MDPs, and to standard techniques for solving linear equations when applied to Markov chains. More importantly, we demonstrate experimentally that these algorithms perform well when applied to MDPs which ``almost'' have the required special structure.},

Theoretical studies, in conjunction with recent empirical discoveries, suggest that the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) might perform some of the essential underlying computations by means of a unique, periodic synaptic matrix that could be self-organized in early development through a simple, symmetry-breaking operation. The scale at which space is represented increases systematically along the dorsoventral axis in both the hippocampus and the MEC, apparently because of systematic variation in the gain of a movement-speed signal. Convergence of spatially periodic input at multiple scales, from so-called grid cells in the entorhinal cortex, might result in non-periodic spatial firing patterns (place fields) in the hippocampus.},

Despite the inherent challenges of surviving in such a world, biological organisms evolve, self-organize, self-repair, navigate, and flourish. Generally, they do so with only local knowledge and without any centralized control. Our computer networks are increasingly facing similar challenges as they grow larger in size, but are yet to be able to achieve the same level of robustness and adaptability. Many research efforts have recognized these parallels, and wondered if there are some lessons to be learned from biological systems. As a result, biologically inspired research in computer networking is a quickly growing field. This article begins by exploring why biology and computer network research are such a natural match. We then present a broad overview of biologically inspired research, grouped by topic, and classified in two ways: by the biological field that inspired each topic, and by the area of networking in which the topic lies. In each case, we elucidate how biological concepts have been most successfully applied. In aggregate, we conclude that research efforts are most successful when they separate biological design from biological implementation \textendash{} that is to say, when they extract the pertinent principles from the former without imposing the limitations of the latter.},

  abstract = {Mobile robots and animals alike must effectively navigate their environments in order to achieve their goals. For animals goal-directed navigation facilitates finding food, seeking shelter or migration; similarly robots perform goal-directed navigation to find a charging station, get out of the rain or guide a person to a destination. This similarity in tasks extends to the environment as well; increasingly, mobile robots are operating in the same underwater, ground and aerial environments that animals do. Yet despite these similarities, goal-directed navigation research in robotics and biology has proceeded largely in parallel, linked only by a small amount of interdisciplinary research spanning both areas. Most state-of-the-art robotic navigation systems employ a range of sensors, world representations and navigation algorithms that seem far removed from what we know of how animals navigate; their navigation systems are shaped by key principles of navigation in `real-world' environments including dealing with uncertainty in sensing, landmark observation and world modelling. By contrast, biomimetic animal navigation models produce plausible animal navigation behaviour in a range of laboratory experimental navigation paradigms, typically without addressing many of these robotic navigation principles. In this paper, we attempt to link robotics and biology by reviewing the current state of the art in conventional and biomimetic goal-directed navigation models, focusing on the key principles of goal-oriented robotic navigation and the extent to which these principles have been adapted by biomimetic navigation models and why.},

This metaheuristic algorithm is based on the levy flight behavior and brood parasitic behavior of cuckoos. A new objective function has been developed between robot and position of the goal and obstacles present in the environment. Depending upon the objective function value of each nest in swarm, the robot avoids obstacles and proceeds towards goal. The optimal path is generated with this algorithm when robot reaches its goal.

Here we review how place cells and grid cells may form the basis for quantitative spatiotemporal representation of places, routes, and associated experiences during behavior and in memory. Because these cell types have some of the most conspicuous behavioral correlates among neurons in nonsensory cortical systems, and because their spatial firing structure reflects computations internally in the system, studies of entorhinal-hippocampal representations may offer considerable insight into general principles of cortical network dynamics.},

Human solutions to pathfinding problems are generally fast but approximate, in contrast to traditional AI approaches. In this paper, we report data on a human search task, and then examine a set of models, based upon the structure of the hippocampus, which use a goal scent mechanism similar to the optimal pathfinding algorithms used in artificial intelligence systems. We compare five distinct search models, and conclude that a goal scent model driven by multiple goals spread throughout the search space provides the best and most accurate account of the human data. This research suggests a convergence in traditional AI and biologically-inspired approaches to pathfinding that may be mutually beneficial.},

However, the question of selecting an appropriate home location has, so far, received only little attention. This is surprising, since the choice of a home location might greatly influence an animal's navigation performance. To address the question of home choice in cluttered environments, a systematic analysis of homing trajectories was performed by computer simulations using a skyline-based local homing method. Our analysis reveals that homing performance strongly depends on the location of the home in the environment. Furthermore, it appears that by assessing homing success in the immediate vicinity of the home, an animal might be able to predict its overall success in returning to it from within a much larger area.},

This is despite the signal-to-noise ratio of the navigational cues being poor at low light conditions. To better understand the evolution of nocturnal life, we investigated the navigational efficiency of a nocturnal ant, Myrmecia pyriformis, at different light levels. Workers of M. pyriformis leave the nest individually in a narrow light-window in the evening twilight to forage on nest-specific Eucalyptus trees. The majority of foragers return to the nest in the morning twilight, while few attempt to return to the nest throughout the night. We found that as light levels dropped, ants paused for longer, walked more slowly, the success in finding the nest reduced and their paths became less straight. We found that in both bright and dark conditions ants relied predominantly on visual landmark information for navigation and that landmark guidance became less reliable at low light conditions. It is perhaps due to the poor navigational efficiency at low light levels that the majority of foragers restrict navigational tasks to the twilight periods, where sufficient navigational information is still available.},

In order to address the challenge properly, it is important to notice that locomotion dynamics are the result of interactions between a particular internal control structure, the mechanical dynamics and the environment. From this perspective, this paper presents an approach to enable a robot to take advantage of its multiple locomotion modes by coupling the mechanical dynamics of the robot with an internal control structure known as an attractor selection model. The robot used is a curved-beam hopping robot; this robot, despite its simple actuation method, possesses rich and complex mechanical dynamics that are dependent on its interactions with the environment. Through dynamical coupling, we will show how this robot performs goal-directed locomotion by gracefully shifting between different locomotion modes regulated by sensory input, the robot's mechanical dynamics and an internally generated perturbation. The efficacy of the approach is validated and discussed based on the simulation and on real-world experiments.},

This paper collects and presents the different represents, models and planning algorithms in the application of path planning of robots. The aims of this paper are to draw a whole procedure of robot path planning, to present a detailed analysis of the available technology in each designing phase, to make a useful comparison in critical performance between different algorithms. All the methods described are based on their characteristic and the performing environment. The analysis shows that despite the large number of methods developed for path planning in different environment and variety usage, considering the complexity, completeness, effectiveness and optimality, random sample based methods are the trend which can be efficiently used to solve practical complex path planning problem. There are also some suggestions of methods' choice in each designing phase such as environment construct, representation, and algorithm.},

This knowledge may come from landmarks present in the environment, the relative position(s) of these landmarks, or available paths along which an observer can reach these landmarks. Recent neurophysiological findings in rats suggest that there are special cells in the hippocampal region of the brain which are responsible for recognizing places in a spatial environment. Based on this present neurophysiological evidence on place identification and the map-building process, the authors propose a computational model for constructing a spatial cognitive map using artificial neural network models. Such a map-building process may be used by a mobile robot to learn its environment automatically through exploration.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {The current paper presents a novel technique for a mobile robot to navigate in a real-world dynamic environment. When an autonomous mobile robot navigates in an unknown environment it is required to plan a path based on the information gathered from sensors in order to avoid obstacles and reach a target. This research idea is related to the basis of human perception, by using heuristic information for the navigation of mobile robots in cluttered dynamic environments which provides a general, robust, safe, and optimized path. The heuristic-rule-based network (HRBN) consists of a simple algorithm which makes the predefined estimation function much smaller. The estimation function should be adequately defined for desired movement in the environment. A navigation system using the rule-based technique allows a mobile robot to travel in an environment about which the robot has no prior knowledge. This heuristic rule is applied in conjunction with an artificial neural network (ANN). The ANN is trained by back-propagation algorithms. The HRBN provides an optimum trajectory which increases the effectiveness of a mobile robot. In a multiple-robot environment, a Petri net model (PNM) is used to prevent inter-robot collision during navigation. A series of simulations and experiments is conducted using mobile robots to show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

The fuzzy grading correspondence with the probabilistic decision is the primary function of moving the mobile robot towards the goal and the secondary is path planning which lies over the probability distribution function. The distance\textendash speed combination rule is developed for effective navigation. The single and multiple mobile robot systems have been tested successfully in a dense environment in presence of obstacles (static and dynamic) and moving goal.

The step by step investigations of classical and reactive approaches are made here to understand the development of path planning strategies in various environmental conditions and to identify research gap. The classical approaches such as cell decomposition (CD), roadmap approach (RA), artificial potential field (APF); reactive approaches such as genetic algorithm (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), neural network (NN), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), ant colony optimization (ACO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO), artificial bee colony (ABC), cuckoo search (CS), shuffled frog leaping algorithm (SFLA) and other miscellaneous algorithms (OMA) are considered for study. The navigation over static and dynamic condition is analyzed (for single and multiple robot systems) and it has been observed that the reactive approaches are more robust and perform well in all terrain when compared to classical approaches. It is also observed that the reactive approaches are used to improve the performance of the classical approaches as a hybrid algorithm. Hence, reactive approaches are more popular and widely used for path planning of mobile robot. The paper concludes with tabular data and charts comparing the frequency of individual navigational strategies which can be used for specific application in robotics.},

However, movement data from individuals are intrinsically stochastic and often subject to severe observation error.

Here, we review a statistical approach, state\textendash space modelling, which involves changing how we analyse movement data and draw inferences about the behaviours that shape it. The statistical robustness and predictive ability of state\textendash space models make them the most promising avenue towards a new type of movement ecology that fuses insights from the study of animal behaviour, biogeography and spatial population dynamics.},

New approaches of ever greater complexity are continue to be added to the literature. In this paper, we review what we believe to be some of the most popular and most useful classes of statistical models used to analyse individual animal movement data. Specifically, we consider discrete-time hidden Markov models, more general state-space models and diffusion processes. We argue that these models should be core components in the toolbox for quantitative researchers working on stochastic modelling of individual animal movement. The paper concludes by offering some general observations on the direction of statistical analysis of animal movement. There is a trend in movement ecology towards what are arguably overly complex modelling approaches which are inaccessible to ecologists, unwieldy with large data sets or not based on mainstream statistical practice. Additionally, some analysis methods developed within the ecological community ignore fundamental properties of movement data, potentially leading to misleading conclusions about animal movement. Corresponding approaches, e.g. based on L\'evy walk-type models, continue to be popular despite having been largely discredited. We contend that there is a need for an appropriate balance between the extremes of either being overly complex or being overly simplistic, whereby the discipline relies on models of intermediate complexity that are usable by general ecologists, but grounded in well-developed statistical practice and efficient to fit to large data sets.},

Inspired by observations of dung beetle navigational strategies that show switching between geocentric and egocentric strategies, we consider the question of optimal reorientation rates for the navigation of an agent moving along a preferred direction in the presence of multiple sources of noise. We address this using a model that takes the form of a correlated random walk at short time scales that is punctuated by reorientation events leading to a biased random walks at long time scales. This allows us to identify optimal alternation schemes and characterize their robustness in the context of noisy sensory acquisition as well as performance errors linked with variations in environmental conditions and agent\textendash environment interactions.},

Here, we combine experiments with a data-driven mathematical model to show that the surface exploration of a pathogenic strain of Escherichia coli results from a complex interplay between motility and transient surface adhesion events. These events allow the bacteria to break the smooth circular trajectories and regulate their transport properties by exploiting stop events that are facilitated by surface adhesion and lead to characteristic intermittent motion on surfaces. We find that the experimentally measured frequency of these stop-adhesion events coincides with the value that maximizes bacterial surface diffusivity according to our mathematical model. We discuss the applicability of our experimental and theoretical results to other bacterial strains on different surfaces. Our findings suggest that swimming bacteria use transient adhesion as a generic mechanism to regulate surface motion.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been much interest in describing the behaviour of animals by fitting various movement models to tracking data. Despite this interest, little is known about how the temporal `grain' of movement trajectories affects the outputs of such models, and how behaviours classified at one timescale may differ from those classified at other scales. Here, we present a study in which random-walk state-space models were fit both to nightly geospatial lifelines of common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) and synthetic trajectories parameterised from empirical observations. Observed trajectories recorded by GPS collars at 5-min intervals were sub-sampled at periods varying between 10 and 60 min, to approximate the effect of collecting data at lower sampling frequencies. Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo fitting techniques, using information about movement rates and turning angles between sequential fixes, were employed using a Bayesian framework to assign distinct behavioural states to individual location estimates. We found that in trajectories with higher temporal granularities behaviours could be clearly differentiated into `slow-area-restricted' and `fast-transiting' states, but for trajectories with longer inter-fix intervals this distinction was markedly less obvious. Specifically, turning-angle distributions varied from being highly peaked around either or at fine temporal scales, to being uniform across all angles at low sampling intervals. Our results highlight the difficulty of comparing model results amongst tracking-data sets that vary substantially in temporal grain, and demonstrate the importance of matching the observed temporal resolution of tracking devices to the timescales of behaviours of interest, otherwise inter-individual comparisons of inferred behaviours may be invalid, or important biological information may be obscured.},

This article provides an overview of the research progress in path planning of a mobile robot for off-line as well as on-line environments. Commonly used classic and evolutionary approaches of path planning of mobile robots have been addressed. Review shows that evolutionary optimization algorithms are computationally efficient and hence are increasingly being used in tandem with classic approaches while handling Non-deterministic Polynomial time hard (NP-hard) problems.

  abstract = {Vision-based mobile robot navigation is a vibrant area of research with numerous algorithms having been developed, the vast majority of which either belong to the scene-oriented simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or fall into the category of robot-oriented lane-detection/trajectory tracking. These methods suffer from high computational cost and require stringent labelling and calibration efforts. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a lightweight robot navigation framework based purely on uncalibrated spherical images. To simplify the orientation estimation, path prediction and improve computational efficiency, the navigation problem is decomposed into a series of classification tasks. To mitigate the adverse effects of insufficient negative samples in the ``navigation via classification'' task, we introduce the spherical camera for scene capturing, which enables 360{$\smwhtcircle$} fisheye panorama as training samples and generation of sufficient positive and negative heading directions. The classification is implemented as an end-to-end Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), trained on our proposed Spherical-Navi image dataset, whose category labels can be efficiently collected. This CNN is capable of predicting potential path directions with high confidence levels based on a single, uncalibrated spherical image. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms competing ones in realistic applications.},

To explore the link between underlying neural circuits and computational principles, we present how a biologically detailed neural circuit model of the insect mushroom body implements sensory processing, learning, and motor control. We focus on cast and surge strategies employed by flying insects when foraging within turbulent odor plumes. Using a spike-based plasticity rule, the model rapidly learns to associate individual olfactory sensory cues paired with food in a classical conditioning paradigm. We show that, without retraining, the system dynamically recalls memories to detect relevant cues in complex sensory scenes. Accumulation of this sensory evidence on short time scales generates cast-and-surge motor commands. Our generic systems approach predicts that population sparseness facilitates learning, while temporal sparseness is required for dynamic memory recall and precise behavioral control. Our work successfully combines biological computational principles with spike-based machine learning. It shows how knowledge transfer from static to arbitrary complex dynamic conditions can be achieved by foraging insects and may serve as inspiration for agent-based machine learning.},

Many different computational models of grid cell firing use path integration based on movement direction and the associated movement speed to drive grid cells. However, the response of neurons to movement direction has rarely been tested, in contrast to multiple studies showing responses of neurons to head direction. Here, we analyzed the difference between head direction and movement direction during rat movement and analyzed cells recorded from entorhinal cortex for their tuning to movement direction. During foraging behavior, movement direction differs significantly from head direction. The analysis of neuron responses shows that only 5 out of 758 medial entorhinal cells show significant coding for both movement direction and head direction when evaluating periods of rat behavior with speeds above 10 cm/sec and {$\pm$}30\textdegree{} angular difference between movement and head direction. None of the cells coded movement direction alone. In contrast, 21 cells in this population coded only head direction during behavioral epochs with these constraints, indicating much stronger coding of head direction in this population. This suggests that the movement direction signal required by most grid cell models may arise from other brain structures than the medial entorhinal cortex.},

The gaming concept is overlaid on a large-scale agent-based simulation of the Anasazi. Agents in this game use a cultural algorithm framework to modify their finite-state automata (FSA) controllers following the work of Fogel (1966). In the game, there can be two kinds of active agents: scripted and unscripted. Unscripted agents attempt to maximize their survivability, whereas scripted agents can be used to test the impact that various pure and compound strategies for cooperation and defection have on the social structures produced by the overall system. The goal of our experiments here is to determine the extent to which cooperation and competition need to be present among the agent households in order to produce a population structure and spatial distribution similar to what has been observed archaeologically. We do this by embedding a "trust in networks" game within the simulation. In this game, agents can choose from three pure strategies: defect, trust, and inspect. This game does not have a pure Nash equilibrium but instead has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium such that a certain proportion of the population uses each at every time step, where the proportion relates to the quality of the signal used by the inspectors to predict defection. We use the cultural algorithm to help us determine what the mix of strategies might have been like in the prehistoric population. The simulation results indeed suggest a mixed strategy consisting of defectors, inspectors, and trustors was necessary to produce results compatible with the archaeological data. It is suggested that the presence of defectors derives from the unreliability of the signal which increases under drought conditions and produced increased stress on Anasazi communities and may have contributed to their departure.},

  abstract = {For many years, the dominant conceptual framework for describing non-oriented animal movement patterns has been the correlated random walk (CRW) model in which an individual's trajectory through space is represented by a sequence of distinct, independent randomly oriented `moves'. It has long been recognized that the transformation of an animal's continuous movement path into a broken line is necessarily arbitrary and that probability distributions of move lengths and turning angles are model artefacts. Continuous-time analogues of CRWs that overcome this inherent shortcoming have appeared in the literature and are gaining prominence. In these models, velocities evolve as a Markovian process and have exponential autocorrelation. Integration of the velocity process gives the position process. Here, through a simple scaling argument and through an exact analytical analysis, it is shown that autocorrelation inevitably leads to L\'evy walk (LW) movement patterns on timescales less than the autocorrelation timescale. This is significant because over recent years there has been an accumulation of evidence from a variety of experimental and theoretical studies that many organisms have movement patterns that can be approximated by LWs, and there is now intense debate about the relative merits of CRWs and LWs as representations of non-orientated animal movement patterns.},

In addition, we explore non-local random walks like L\textbackslash 'evy flights on networks, fractional transport and applications in the context of human mobility. Explicit relations for the stationary probability distribution, the mean first passage time and global times to characterize the random walk strategies are obtained in terms of the elements of the matrix of weights and its respective eigenvalues and eigenvectors.

  abstract = {Current applications for wayfinding and navigation assistance usually calculate the route to a destination based on the shortest or fastest path from the origin. However, numerous findings in cognitive science show that the ease of use and communication of route instructions depends on factors other than just the length of a route, such as the number and complexity of decision points. Building on previous work to improve the automatic generation of route instructions, this paper presents an algorithm for finding routes associated with the ``simplest'' instructions, taking into account fundamental principles of human direction giving, namely decision point complexity, references to landmarks, and spatial chunking. The algorithm presented can be computed in the same order of time complexity as Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, O(n2). Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the algorithm's performance is comparable to previous work on ``simplest paths,'' with an average increase of path length of about 10\% compared to the shortest path. However, the instructions generated are on average 50\% shorter than those for shortest or simplest paths. The conclusions argue that the compactness of the descriptions, in combination with the incorporation of the basic cognitive principles of chunking and landmarks, provides evidence that these instructions are easier to understand.},

  abstract = {Animals must routinely deal with barriers as they move through their natural environment. These challenges require directed changes in leg movements and posture performed in the context of ever changing internal and external conditions. In particular, cockroaches use a combination of tactile and visual information to evaluate objects in their path in order to effectively guide their movements in complex terrain. When encountering a large block, the insect uses its antennae to evaluate the object's height then rears upward accordingly before climbing. A shelf presents a choice between climbing and tunneling that depends on how the antennae strike the shelf; tapping from above yields climbing, while tapping from below causes tunneling. However, ambient light conditions detected by the ocelli can bias that decision. Similarly, in a T-maze turning is determined by antennal contact but influenced by visual cues. These multi-sensory behaviors led us to look at the central complex as a center for sensori-motor integration within the insect brain. Visual and antennal tactile cues are processed within the central complex and, in tethered preparations, several central complex units changed firing rates in tandem with or prior to altered step frequency or turning, while stimulation through the implanted electrodes evoked these same behavioral changes. To further test for a central complex role in these decisions, we examined behavioral effects of brain lesions. Electrolytic lesions in restricted regions of the central complex generated site specific behavioral deficits. Similar changes were also found in reversible effects of procaine injections in the brain. Finally, we are examining these kinds of decisions made in a large arena that more closely matches the conditions under which cockroaches forage. Overall, our studies suggest that CC circuits may indeed influence the descending commands associated with navigational decisions, thereby making them more context dependent.},

There have been unprecedented recent neuroscience breakthroughs with             Drosophila             in behavioral and neural imaging experiments as well as the mapping of detailed connectivity of neural structures. General mechanisms for learning orientation in the central complex (CX) of             Drosophila             have been investigated previously; however, it is unclear how these underlying mechanisms extend to cases where there is translation through an environment (beyond only rotation), which is critical for navigation in robotic systems.

In many experimental protocols, observations are recorded with a fixed sampling interval and the continuous underlying motion is approximated as a series of discrete steps. The size of the sampling interval significantly affects the tracking measurements, the statistics computed from observed trajectories, and the inferences drawn. Despite the widespread use of tracking data to investigate motile behaviour, many open questions remain about these effects. We use a correlated random walk model to study the variation with sampling interval of two key quantities of interest: apparent speed and angle change. Two variants of the model are considered, in which reorientations occur instantaneously and with a stationary pause, respectively. We employ stochastic simulations to study the effect of sampling on the distributions of apparent speeds and angle changes, and present novel mathematical analysis in the case of rapid sampling. Our investigation elucidates the complex nature of sampling effects for sampling intervals ranging over many orders of magnitude. Results show that inclusion of a stationary phase significantly alters the observed distributions of both quantities.},

The advent of autonomous moderate-size machines in the field appears as a prospective way of promoting the sustainable production of food in Europe, Japan, and North America. However, there exist important obstacles to the broad expansion of autonomous robots in the field; reliability, safeguarding, system complexity, and cost-efficiency in particular rank high among the impediments to overcome before prototypes move into the production stage. Robot navigation is essential for the successful deployment of autonomous machines in conventional farms, as a minimum level of safety has to be granted at the same time that navigation engines cannot be too sophisticated for solutions to compete with current equipment. In such compromise, global navigation satellite systems play a key role due to its wide range of solutions, and an important number of limitations. In this research, a variety of experiments were conducted to determine the scope of GNSS solutions as a principal component of the navigation system of novel farm robots. Results showed that regardless of the quality of the receiver used, multipath and other uncontrollable errors eventually occur in the field, and therefore signal consistency must be continuously checked by the robot's navigation engine. Different strategies based on the meticulous analysis of NMEA strings, the optimal combination of GGA and VTG messages, and the trajectory-based redundant estimation of robot planar states are proposed to enhance the integration of GNSS measurements in the navigation engine of agricultural robots.},

  abstract = {Pathfinding is essential and necessary for agent movement used in computer games and many other applications. A primary concern of pathfinding is to find the shortest feasible path. The past decade has seen the rapid development of pathfinding in many games industry. Several attempts and solutions have been made to solve the problem. Heuristic A* algorithm has proven given an optimal for single agent and small size of search in current game industry. However, pathfinding solution is often requiring huge amount of resources especially in complex game environment. Hence, generation a feasible and optimal path more computationally burdensome or intractable. More recently, literature has come out that offers findings about metaheuristic in pathfinding. Metaheuristic is usually used in pathfinding problem. Bee algorithm is a metaheuristic algorithm which is naturally behaves as multi-agent approach and proven efficient in solving the path planning problem. The current research on Bee algorithm mostly focused on improving optimization for agent. The aim of this paper is to describe and compare traditional algorithm, A* algorithm and optimization search, Bee algorithm in pathfinding.},

Whereas some insects operate solitarily, others collectively build large and complex structures. The architecture of these structures vis-\`a-vis their ultimate function poses fascinating questions that require multidisciplinary investigations. Importantly, because the underlying design and architectural principles have evolved over millions of years to withstand multitude of environmental perturbations, they offer important lessons for human-made structures. The vast variety of insect-built structures reflects how diverse insects have adapted to resolve the ecological challenges in their specific habitats. Here, we survey insect-built structures from a comparative perspective to ask what design and architectural principles can be gleaned from them. We discuss the key hypotheses about building-behaviours, their neural underpinnings, the functional role of insect-built structures and their biomimetic potential.},

In studying the hippocampal formation, it is fruitful to think of path integration as a computation that transforms a sense of motion into a sense of location, continuously integrated with landmark perception. Here, we review experimental evidence that path integration is intimately involved in fundamental properties of place cells and other spatial cells that are thought to support a cognitive abstraction of space in this brain system. We discuss hypotheses about the anatomical and computational origin of path integration in the wellcharacterized circuits of the rodent limbic system. We highlight how computational frameworks for map-building in robotics and cognitive science alike suggest an essential role for path integration in the creation of a new map in unfamiliar territory, and how this very role can help us make sense of differences in neurophysiological data from novel versus familiar and small versus large environments. Similar computational principles could be at work when the hippocampus builds certain non-spatial representations, such as time intervals or trajectories defined in a sensory stimulus space.},

This survey shows that the previous CFPP papers can be divided based on four characteristics. The performance of each method primarily used to solve CFPP in previous research is evaluated and compared. Several methods are implemented and tested in same computing environment to compare the performance of generating solution in specified spatial environment with different obstacles or size. The strengths and weakness of each methodology for CFPP are shown through this survey. Ideally, this paper will provide reference for new future research.},

The challenge of identifying mechanisms for grid firing has been addressed through experimental and theoretical investigations of medial entorhinal circuits. Here, we discuss evidence for continuous attractor network models that account for grid firing by synaptic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory cells. These models assume that grid-like firing patterns are the result of computation of location from velocity inputs, with additional spatial input required to oppose drift in the attractor state. We focus on properties of continuous attractor networks that are revealed by explicitly considering excitatory and inhibitory neurons, their connectivity and their membrane potential dynamics. Models at this level of detail can account for theta-nested gamma oscillations as well as grid firing, predict spatial firing of interneurons as well as excitatory cells, show how gamma oscillations can be modulated independently from spatial computations, reveal critical roles for neuronal noise, and demonstrate that only a subset of excitatory cells in a network need have grid-like firing fields. Evaluating experimental data against predictions from detailed network models will be important for establishing the mechanisms mediating grid firing.},

Computer modeling has shown that collective behavior of simple agents can result from simple interactions between the agents, which include short range repulsion, intermediate range alignment, and long range attraction. Here we study collective navigation of bacteria-inspired smart agents in complex terrains, with adaptive interactions that depend on performance. More specifically, each agent adjusts its interactions with the other agents according to its local environment \textendash{} by decreasing the peers' influence while navigating in a beneficial direction, and increasing it otherwise. We show that inclusion of such performance dependent adaptable interactions significantly improves the collective swarming performance, leading to highly efficient navigation, especially in complex terrains. Notably, to afford such adaptable interactions, each modeled agent requires only simple computational capabilities with short-term memory, which can easily be implemented in simple swarming robots.},

Compared to grid-mapping approaches, vector-based mapping algorithms require a relatively small amount of memory. Two essential operations for successful vector mapping are vector merging and loop closing. Merging methods used by traditional line segment-based mapping algorithms do not consider the sensor characteristics, which causes additional mapping error and makes it harder to close loops after navigation over a long distance. In addition, few line segment-based SLAM approaches contain loop closing methodology. We present a novel vector merging scheme based on a recursive least square estimation for robust mapping. An efficient loop closing method is also proposed, which effectively distributes the resultant mapping error throughout the loop to guarantee global map consistency. Simulation studies and experimental results show that VecSLAM is an efficient and robust online localization and mapping algorithm.},

Here we report a computational analysis that aligns Bayesian nonparametrics and model-based reinforcement learning (MB-RL) to the functioning of the hippocampus (HC) and the ventral striatum (vStr)\textendash a neuronal circuit that increasingly recognized to be an appropriate model system to understand goal-directed (spatial) decisions and planning mechanisms in the brain.

Our simulations also explore the benefits of biological forms of look-ahead prediction (forward sweeps) during both learning and control.

Examples include head direction cells in rats and primates, place cells in rats and spatial view cells in primates. 'Continuous attractor' neural networks model these continuous physical spaces by using recurrent collateral connections between the neurons which reflect the distance between the neurons in the state space (e.g. head direction space) of the animal. These networks maintain a localized packet of neuronal activity representing the current state of the animal. We show how the synaptic connections in a one-dimensional continuous attractor network (of for example head direction cells) could be self-organized by associative learning. We also show how the activity packet could be moved from one location to another by idiothetic (self-motion) inputs, for example vestibular or proprioceptive, and how the synaptic connections could self-organize to implement this. The models described use 'trace' associative synaptic learning rules that utilize a form of temporal average of recent cell activity to associate the firing of rotation cells with the recent change in the representation of the head direction in the continuous attractor. We also show how a nonlinear neuronal activation function that could be implemented by NMDA receptors could contribute to the stability of the activity packet that represents the current state of the animal.},

Many research papers use different problem sets, making it difficult to compare results between papers. Furthermore, the performance characteristics of each test set are not necessarily obvious. This has motivated the creation of a standard test set of maps and problems on the maps that are open for all researchers to use. In addition to creating these sets, we use a variety of metrics to analyze the properties of the test sets.

  abstract = {Most bacteria at certain stages of their life cycle are able to move actively; they can swim in a liquid or crawl on various surfaces. A typical path of the moving cell often resembles the trajectory of a random walk. However, bacteria are capable of modifying their apparently random motion in response to changing environmental conditions. As a result, bacteria can migrate towards the source of nutrients or away from harmful chemicals. Surprisingly, many bacterial species that were studied have several distinct motility patterns, which can be theoretically modeled by a unifying random walk approach. We use this approach to quantify the process of cell dispersal in a homogeneous environment and show how the bacterial drift velocity towards the source of attracting chemicals is affected by the motility pattern of the bacteria. Our results open up the possibility of accessing additional information about the intrinsic response of the cells using macroscopic observations of bacteria moving in inhomogeneous environments.},

In dieser Arbeit untersuchen wir mit Methoden der Statistischen Physik Aspekte, die im fr\"uhen Entwicklungsstadium von Biofilmen relevant sind. Die Fortbewegungsstrategien von Bakterien lassen sich als Zufallsbewegungen charakterisieren: "Run-and-tumble" f\"ur das Darmbakterium E. coli, "Run-reverse" f\"ur den Krankheitserreger P. aeruginosa oder "Run-reverse-flick" f\"ur das Meeresbakterium V. alginolyticus. Zum quantitativen Vergleich dieser unterschiedlichen Bewegungsmuster entwickeln wir eine verallgemeinerte Zufallsbewegung, f\"ur die wir analytisch den Diffusionskoeffizienten als Ma\ss{} der Zellmotilit\"at bestimmen. In inhomogener Umgebung k\"onnen Mikroorganismen ihre Bewegung entlang eines chemischen Gradienten ausrichten, was als Chemotaxis bezeichnet wird. Um die chemotaktische Effizienz zu vergleichen, berechnen wir die chemotaktische Driftgeschwindigkeit, mit der sich ein "Run-tumble-flick"-Bakterium einer Nahrungsquelle n\"ahert. Sobald Mikroorganismen sich auf einer Oberfl\"ache anlagern, aktiviert "Kommunikation" zwischen einzelnen Zellen die Bildung von Mikrokolonien und damit die Entstehung eines Biofilms. Coli-Bakterien, Salmonellen oder Am\"oben k\"onnen selbst chemische Stoffe produzieren, auf die die jeweilige Zellpopulation chemotaktisch reagiert. Diese Mikroorganismen inspirieren unser Modell f\"ur aktive, "autochemotaktische" Teilchen. Wir zeigen, dass die chemotaktische Wechselwirkung bei unseren Modellorganismen die Bildung von Zellaggregaten bewirkt, was im Einklang mit zahlreichen Experimenten steht. F\"ur die diffusive Langzeitdynamik eines isolierten Modellteilchens geben wir den Diffusionskoeffizienten analytisch an.

Cells within several limbic system areas of the mammalian brain discharge allocentrically as a function of the animal's directional heading, independent of the animal's location and ongoing behavior. These cells are referred to as head direction (HD) cells and are believed to encode the animal's perceived directional heading with respect to its environment. Although HD cells are found in several areas, the principal circuit for generating this signal originates in the dorsal tegmental nucleus and projects serially, with some reciprocal connections, to the lateral mammillary nucleus \textrightarrow{} anterodorsal thalamus \textrightarrow{} PoS, and terminates in the entorhinal cortex. HD cells receive multimodal information about landmarks and self-generated movements. Vestibular information appears critical for generating the directional signal, but motor/proprioceptive and landmark information are important for updating it.},

Typical approaches to human prediction simply assume a constant velocity which is not always valid. This paper proposes to determine the likely navigation intent of humans and use that to predict human motion. Navigation intent is determined by the function and structure of the environment. Manually assigned functional places are combined with automatically extracted navigation way-points to define a number of likely navigation targets within the environment. To predict human motion toward these targets, a probabilistic model of human motion is proposed which is based on motion probability grids generated from observed motion. The models of human navigation intent and motion are integrated with an autonomous mobile robot system, with a laser range sensor detecting humans moving within the environment, and a path planning system. The models of human navigation intent and motion are verified using real captured human motion data from an office environment. Examples of human motion prediction are also presented.},

  abstract = {Animal tracking is a growing field in ecology and previous work has shown that simple speed filtering of tracking data is not sufficient and that improvement of tracking location estimates are possible. To date, this has required methods that are complicated and often time-consuming (state-space models), resulting in limited application of this technique and the potential for analysis errors due to poor understanding of the fundamental framework behind the approach. We describe and test an alternative and intuitive approach consisting of bootstrapping random walks biased by forward particles. The model uses recorded data accuracy estimates, and can assimilate other sources of data such as sea-surface temperature, bathymetry and/or physical boundaries. We tested our model using ARGOS and geolocation tracks of elephant seals that also carried GPS tags in addition to PTTs, enabling true validation. Among pinnipeds, elephant seals are extreme divers that spend little time at the surface, which considerably impact the quality of both ARGOS and light-based geolocation tracks. Despite such low overall quality tracks, our model provided location estimates within 4.0, 5.5 and 12.0 km of true location 50\% of the time, and within 9, 10.5 and 20.0 km 90\% of the time, for above, equal or below average elephant seal ARGOS track qualities, respectively. With geolocation data, 50\% of errors were less than 104.8 km ({$<$}0.94\textdegree ), and 90\% were less than 199.8 km ({$<$}1.80\textdegree ). Larger errors were due to lack of sea-surface temperature gradients. In addition we show that our model is flexible enough to solve the obstacle avoidance problem by assimilating high resolution coastline data. This reduced the number of invalid on-land location by almost an order of magnitude. The method is intuitive, flexible and efficient, promising extensive utilization in future research.},

  abstract = {Recent years have witnessed an exponential growth in the number of identified interactions between biological molecules. These interactions are usually represented as large and complex networks, calling for the development of appropriated tools to exploit the functional information they contain. Random walk with restart (RWR) is the state-of-the-art guilt-by-association approach. It explores the network vicinity of gene/protein seeds to study their functions, based on the premise that nodes related to similar functions tend to lie close to each other in the networks.In this study, we extended the RWR algorithm to multiplex and heterogeneous networks. The walk can now explore different layers of physical and functional interactions between genes and proteins, such as protein\textendash protein interactions and co-expression associations. In addition, the walk can also jump to a network containing different sets of edges and nodes, such as phenotype similarities between diseases. We devised a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy to evaluate the algorithms abilities to predict disease-associated genes. We demonstrate the increased performances of the multiplex-heterogeneous RWR as compared to several random walks on monoplex or heterogeneous networks. Overall, our framework is able to leverage the different interaction sources to outperform current approaches. Finally, we applied the algorithm to predict candidate genes for the Wiedemann\textendash Rautenstrauch syndrome, and to explore the network vicinity of the SHORT syndrome.The source code is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/alberto-valdeolivas/RWR-MH.

This paper presents the comparison between a vector-based algorithm and several raster-based algorithms for solving the cross country movement planning problem. Besides three known raster methods (standard, moreconnected, and quadtree), a new method, extended raster approach, has been designed and implemented. The latter nds better solutions because of the higher degree of freedom when moving through a rasterized terrain, that is, more directions can be followed. The vector method of Mitchell and Papadimitriou has also been implemented for comparison. Assuming a reasonable sized terrain with a reasonable accuracy all methods have performance problems. Therefore, a hierarchical approach is presented which can be applied in both the vector and raster domain. This approach will nd the optimal path in contrast to other hierarchical approaches, which do not guarantee to nd the optimal path, but often return a good path. The performance improvement should make the hierarchical approach suitable for interactive movement planning tasks.},

  abstract = {Path integration is a navigation strategy widely observed in nature where an animal maintains a running estimate, called the home vector, of its location during an excursion. Evidence suggests it is both ancient and ubiquitous in nature, and has been studied for over a century. In that time, canonical and neural network models have flourished, based on a wide range of assumptions, justifications and supporting data. Despite the importance of the phenomenon, consensus and unifying principles appear lacking. A fundamental issue is the neural representation of space needed for biological path integration. This paper presents a scheme to classify path integration systems on the basis of the way the home vector records and updates the spatial relationship between the animal and its home location. Four extended classes of coordinate systems are used to unify and review both canonical and neural network models of path integration, from the arthropod and mammalian literature. This scheme demonstrates analytical equivalence between models which may otherwise appear unrelated, and distinguishes between models which may superficially appear similar. A thorough analysis is carried out of the equational forms of important facets of path integration including updating, steering, searching and systematic errors, using each of the four coordinate systems. The type of available directional cue, namely allothetic or idiothetic, is also considered. It is shown that on balance, the class of home vectors which includes the geocentric Cartesian coordinate system, appears to be the most robust for biological systems. A key conclusion is that deducing computational structure from behavioural data alone will be difficult or impossible, at least in the absence of an analysis of random errors. Consequently it is likely that further theoretical insights into path integration will require an in-depth study of the effect of noise on the four classes of home vectors.},

  abstract = {Considering the biological or artificial trajectory generation problem, we propose a biologically plausible model of the link between the (i) local "where-to-go-next" local mechanism in a locus map and the (ii) global trajectory generation problem. This explains how the well known hippocampal related areas containing place fields with local mechanisms are also very likely able to solve the global problem, providing the neural map activity is related to harmonic potentials. Such representation assume that obstacles to avoid (or constraints not to violate) correspond to maxima of a so-called potential, while the goal corresponds to its minimum. The corresponding algorithm thus behaves as if one throws a sheet onto this state space, this hyper-surface relief being elevated on obstacles, with a hole at the goal location. Finding a trajectory thus reduces to "roll down" along this relief, in the direction of the potential gradient. The originality of the present work is to build an harmonic potential (thus without local minimum) from a sparse adaptive combination of elementary place fields, as inspired by the biological modelization of the hippocampal structures. This leads to an internal representation of the problem as a non-topographical map, incrementally built during the system exploration. As such, it provides a key element for a biologically plausible model of the related hippocampus mechanisms in coherence with usual biological assumptions about such behavior.},

  abstract = {Chemotactic movement of Escherichia coli is one of the most thoroughly studied paradigms of simple behavior. Due to significant competitive advantage conferred by chemotaxis and to high evolution rates in bacteria, the chemotaxis system is expected to be strongly optimized. Bacteria follow gradients by performing temporal comparisons of chemoeffector concentrations along their runs, a strategy which is most efficient given their size and swimming speed. Concentration differences are detected by a sensory system and transmitted to modulate rotation of flagellar motors, decreasing the probability of a tumble and reorientation if the perceived concentration change during a run is positive. Such regulation of tumble probability is of itself sufficient to explain chemotactic drift of a population up the gradient, and is commonly assumed to be the only navigation mechanism of chemotactic E. coli. Here we use computer simulations to predict existence of an additional mechanism of gradient navigation in E. coli. Based on the experimentally observed dependence of cell tumbling angle on the number of switching motors, we suggest that not only the tumbling probability but also the degree of reorientation during a tumble depend on the swimming direction along the gradient. Although the difference in mean tumbling angles up and down the gradient predicted by our model is small, it results in a dramatic enhancement of the cellular drift velocity along the gradient. We thus demonstrate a new level of optimization in E. coli chemotaxis, which arises from the switching of several flagellar motors and a resulting fine tuning of tumbling angle. Similar strategy is likely to be used by other peritrichously flagellated bacteria, and indicates yet another level of evolutionary development of bacterial chemotaxis.},

This study explores the implementation of many meta-heuristic algorithms, e.g. Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Cuckoo Search Algorithm (CSA) in multiple motion planning scenarios. The study provides comparison between multiple meta-heuristic approaches against a set of well-known conventional motion planning and navigation techniques such as Dijkstra's Algo\- rithm (DA), Probabilistic Road Map (PRM), Rapidly Random Tree (RRT) and Potential Field (PF). Two experi\- mental environments with difficult to manipulate layouts are used to examine the feasibility of the methods listed. several performance measures such as total travel time, number of collisions, travel distances, energy consumption and displacement errors are considered for assessing feasibility of the motion planning algorithms considered in the study. The results show the competitiveness of meta-heuristic approaches against conventional methods. Dijkstra 's Algorithm (DA) is considered a benchmark solution and Constricted Particle Swarm Opti\- mization (CPSO) is found performing better than other meta-heuristic approaches in unknown environments.},

In this paper, a new weighted adjacency matrix is presented to determine the walking direction and the narrow aisles therefore are avoided by redesigning the walking rules. Also, the best ant and the worst ant are introduced for the adjustment of pheromone to facilitate the searching process. The proposed algorithm guarantees that robots are able to find a satisfying path in the presence of narrow aisles. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

  abstract = {Simulating animal movement in spatially explicit individual-based models (IBMs) is both challenging and critically important to accurately estimating population dynamics. A number of different approaches have been developed that make different assumptions about how individuals move in their environment and use different mathematics to translate movement cues into a behavioral response. Properly calibrated movement models should produce realistic movement in both conditions encountered during calibration and in novel conditions; however, most studies to date have not tested movement models in novel conditions. We compared four distinct movement approaches or sub-models (restricted-area search, kinesis, event-based, and run and tumble) using an IBM loosely based on a small pelagic fish (e.g. Engraulidae) that simulated growth, mortality, and movement of a cohort on a 2-dimensional grid. We trained the sub-models with a genetic algorithm in one set of environmental conditions and then tested them in other three environments. The sub-models generally performed well in novel environments, except restricted-area search and event-based that needed to be trained in environments with gradients similar to the test environment. Also, run and tumble produced near-random distributions in all training environments except the one with the steepest habitat quality gradient, and it produced random distributions in all novel test environments. In selecting a movement sub-model, researchers should consider the assumptions of potential sub-models, the observed movement patterns of the species of interest, and the shape and steepness of the underlying habitat quality gradient.},

Many species use path integration to maintain an accurate estimate of their distance and direction (a vector) to their nest and can store the vector information for multiple salient locations in the world, such as food sources, in a common coordinate system. Insects can also use remembered views of the terrain around salient locations or along travelled routes to guide return, which is a fundamentally geometric process. Recent modelling of these abilities shows convergence on a small set of algorithms and assumptions that appear sufficient to account for a wide range of behavioural data. Notably, this `base model' does not include any significant topological knowledge: the insect does not need to recover the information (implicit in their vector memory) about the relationships between salient places; nor to maintain any connectedness or ordering information between view memories; nor to form any associations between views and vectors. However, there remains some experimental evidence not fully explained by this base model that may point towards the existence of a more complex or integrated mental map in insects.},

Nature inspired routing protocols have been becoming the focus of research because they achieve the complex task of routing through simple agents which traverse the network and collect the routing information in an asynchronous fashion. Each node in the network has a limited information about the state of the network, and it routes data packets to their destination based on this local information. The agent-based routing algorithms provide adaptive and efficient utilization of network resources in response to changes in the network catering for load balancing and fault management. The paper describes the important features of stigmergic routing algorithms, evolutionary routing algorithms and artificial intelligence routing algorithms for fixed telecommunication networks. We also provide a summary of the protocols developed by the networking community. We believe that the survey will be instrumental in bridging the gap among different communities involved in research of telecommunication networks.},

In the first case positional information is obtained by dead reckoning (route integration). A route-integration system provides the animal with a continuous representation of its spatial position relative to its starting point (home). Like a rigidly tightened thread of Ariadne a homeward-bound vector always connects the animal with home. In the second case, the animal is expected to use a map-based system of navigation, i.e. to obtain positional information by virtue of the spatial position it occupies in the larger environmental framework. Rather than relying on information continuously collected en route (dead reckoning), an animal using the mental analogue of a topographical map can episodically take a positional fix, i.e. rely on information collected on site. In central-place foragers like social hymenopterans route-integration based on external systems of reference (e.g. celestial polarization patterns) is the predominant mechanism of navigation, but there is still substantial debate about the extent to which map-based information is used as well. The present account focuses on the computational and neural representations of the bee's and ant's way of integrating circuitous routes, and discusses the extent to which landmark-based information is used in addition.},

The general message is thatCataglyphis uses path integration as an egocentric guideline to acquire continually updated spatial information about places and routes. Hence, it relies on procedural knowledge, and largely context-dependent retrieval of such knowledge, rather than on all-embracing geocentred representations of space.},

We use L\'evy walks on networks as an example, and demonstrate that the proposed approach can unravel the interplay between diffusion dynamics of L\'evy walks and the underlying network structure. Moreover, applying our framework to the famous PageRank search, we show how to inform the optimality of the PageRank search.

The existing robot navigation techniques conclude a diverse spectrum of applications in 2D space.

This paper proposes a novel technique for navigation planning in 3D space for a combination of a mobile platform and a robot arm. The proposed method was derived using the field based navigation techniques to the robot end effector. Applicability of the proposed mathematical model was first derived and simulated for a 2D environment. Proposed mathematical model applicability in 3D space for a single obstacle environment and multiple obstacle environment was analyzed in this paper. The 3D model can be applied to a robot with end effector and the complete solution set was given to overcome the drawbacks of the system. The performance and applicability of the proposed navigation model is also confirmed using a Matlab simulation. The tuning of the model would create different path trajectories and these would be applicable for different types of environments. The proposed algorithm can be applied in a mobile robot platform with a robot arm and sensors to detect depth and position of robot.},

  abstract = {Navigation plays an essential role for many animals leading a mobile mode of life, and for central place foragers in particular. One important prerequisite for navigation is the ability to estimate distances covered during locomotion. It has been shown that Cataglyphis desert ants, well-established model organisms in insect navigation, use two odometer mechanisms, namely, stride and optic flow integration. Although both mechanisms are well established, their mode of interaction to build one odometer output remains enigmatic. We tackle this problem by selectively covering the ventral eye parts in Cataglyphis fortis foragers, the eye regions responsible for optic flow input in odometry. Exclusion of optic flow cues was implemented during different sections of outbound and inbound travel. This demonstrated that the two odometers have separate distance memories that interact in determining homing distance. Possible interpretations posit that the two odometer memories (i) take on different relative weights according to context or (ii) compete in a winner-take-all mode. Explanatory values and implications of such interpretations are discussed. We are able to provide a rough quantitative assessment of odometer cue interaction. An understanding of the interaction of different odometer mechanisms appears valuable not only for animal navigation research but may inform discussions on sensor fusion in both behavioural contexts and potential technical applications.},

The ER process is normally performed in simulation in order to reduce the time required and robot wear. Simulator development is a time consuming process which requires expert knowledge and must traditionally be completed before the ER process can commence. Traditional simulators have limited accuracy, can be computationally expensive and typically do not account for minor operational differences between physical robots. This research proposes the automatic creation of simulators concurrently with the normal ER process. The simulator is derived from an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to remove the need for formulating an analytical model for the robot. The ANN simulator is improved concurrently with the ER process through real-world controller evaluations which continuously generate behavioural data. Simultaneously, the ER process is informed by the improving simulator to evolve better controllers which are periodically evaluated in the real-world. Hence, the concurrent processes provide further targeted behavioural data for simulator improvement. The concurrent and real-time creation of both controllers and ANN-based simulators is successfully demonstrated for a differentially-steered mobile robot. Various parameter settings in the proposed algorithm are investigated to determine factors pertinent to the success of the proposed approach.},

The results demonstrate that the generalized wavefront algorithm generates smooth and safe paths around obstacles that meet the required kinematic conditions associated with the actual maneuverability of mobile robots and significantly reduces the planned path length compared with the results obtained with the algorithm and the optimized RRT algorithm with a computation time acceptable for real-time applications. Therefore, the generated path is not only smooth and effective but also conforms to actual robot maneuverability in practical applications.},

  abstract = {The remarkable navigational abilities of social insects are proof that small brains can produce exquisitely efficient, robust navigation in complex environments. Because social insects produce specialist foragers that are amenable to field and laboratory studies, they have been productive model systems for studies of navigation. Ideas derived from these studies of insect navigation have shown how simple mechanisms can produce robust and seemingly complex behaviour. This is important for a general understanding of spatial cognition as these `insect-like' navigational behaviours are probably phylogenetically widespread. Current insect research is helping to show how simple panoramic views, without the need for cognitive processes such as object identification or labelling, can provide explanations for many findings, including behaviours that in the vertebrate literature have traditionally drawn conclusions about sophisticated high-level spatial modules or learning rules. Recent insect navigation research has only been possible because of techniques enabling the recording of visual scenes from the perspective of the insect. Without such techniques one has to intuit an animal's point of view (its Umwelt) and we discuss how this may lead to unhelpful assumptions about the cues available for navigation.},

  abstract = {A random walk is known as a random process which describes a path including a succession of random steps in the mathematical space. It has increasingly been popular in various disciplines such as mathematics and computer science. Furthermore, in quantum mechanics, quantum walks can be regarded as quantum analogues of classical random walks. Classical random walks and quantum walks can be used to calculate the proximity between nodes and extract the topology in the network. Various random walk related models can be applied in different fields, which is of great significance to downstream tasks such as link prediction, recommendation, computer vision, semi-supervised learning, and network embedding. In this article, we aim to provide a comprehensive review of classical random walks and quantum walks. We first review the knowledge of classical random walks and quantum walks, including basic concepts and some typical algorithms. We also compare the algorithms based on quantum walks and classical random walks from the perspective of time complexity. Then we introduce their applications in the field of computer science. Finally we discuss the open issues from the perspectives of efficiency, main-memory volume, and computing time of existing algorithms. This study aims to contribute to this growing area of research by exploring random walks and quantum walks together.},

  abstract = {The backpropagation (BP) algorithm is often thought to be biologically implausible in the brain. One of the main reasons is that BP requires symmetric weight matrices in the feedforward and feedback pathways. To address this ``weight transport problem'' (Grossberg, 1987), two more biologically plausible algorithms, proposed by Liao et al. (2016) and Lillicrap et al. (2016), relax BP's weight symmetry requirements and demonstrate comparable learning capabilities to that of BP on small datasets. However, a recent study by Bartunov et al. (2018) evaluate variants of target-propagation (TP) and feedback alignment (FA) on MINIST, CIFAR, and ImageNet datasets, and find that although many of the proposed algorithms perform well on MNIST and CIFAR, they perform significantly worse than BP on ImageNet. Here, we additionally evaluate the sign-symmetry algorithm (Liao et al., 2016), which differs from both BP and FA in that the feedback and feedforward weights share signs but not magnitudes. We examine the performance of sign-symmetry and feedback alignment on ImageNet and MS COCO datasets using different network architectures (ResNet-18 and AlexNet for ImageNet, RetinaNet for MS COCO). Surprisingly, networks trained with sign-symmetry can attain classification performance approaching that of BP-trained networks. These results complement the study by Bartunov et al. (2018), and establish a new benchmark for future biologically plausible learning algorithms on more difficult datasets and more complex architectures.},

  abstract = {Most conventional motion planning algorithms that are based on the model of the environment cannot perform well when dealing with the navigation problem for real-world mobile robots where the environment is unknown and can change dynamically. In this paper, a layered goal-oriented motion planning strategy using fuzzy logic is developed for a mobile robot navigating in an unknown environment. The information about the global goal and the long-range sensory data are used by the first layer of the planner to produce an intermediate goal, referred to as the way-point, that gives a favorable direction in terms of seeking the goal within the detected area. The second layer of the planner takes this way-point as a subgoal and, using short-range sensory data, guides the robot to reach the subgoal while avoiding collisions. The resulting path, connecting an initial point to a goal position, is similar to the path produced by the visibility graph motion planning method, but in this approach there is no assumption about the environment. Due to its simplicity and capability for real-time implementation, fuzzy logic has been used for the proposed motion planning strategy. The resulting navigation system is implemented on a real mobile robot, Koala, and tested in various environments. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed fuzzy navigation system.},

In this paper, we propose a novel bottom-up saliency model for detecting salient objects in natural images. First, inspired by the recent advance in the realm of statistical thermodynamics, we adopt a novel mathematical model, namely, the maximal entropy random walk (MERW) to measure saliency. We analyze the rationality and superiority of MERW for modeling visual saliency. Then, based on the MERW model, we establish a generic framework for saliency detection. Different from the vast majority of existing saliency models, our method is built on a purely region-based strategy, which is able to yield high-resolution saliency maps with well preserved object shapes and uniformly highlighted salient regions. In the proposed framework, the input image is first over-segmented into superpixels, which are taken as the primary units for subsequent procedures, and regional features are extracted. Then, saliency is measured according to two principles, i.e., uniqueness and visual organization, both implemented in a unified approach, i.e., the MERW model based on graph representation. Intensive experimental results on publicly available datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art saliency models.},

Studies of social animals and social insects have resulted in a number of computational models of swarm intelligence. Within these swarms their collective behavior is usually very complex. The collective behavior of a swarm of social organisms emerges from the behaviors of the individuals of that swarm. Researchers have developed computational optimization methods based on biology such as Genetic Algorithms, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony. The aim of this paper is to describe an optimization algorithm called the Bees Algorithm, inspired from the natural foraging behavior of honey bees, to find the optimal solution. The algorithm performs both an exploitative neighborhood search combined with random explorative search. In this paper, after an explanation of the natural foraging behavior of honey bees, the basic Bees Algorithm and its improved versions are described and are implemented in order to optimize several benchmark functions, and the results are compared with those obtained with different optimization algorithms. The results show that the Bees Algorithm offering some advantage over other optimization methods according to the nature of the problem.},

  abstract = {Spatial navigation depends on the combination of multiple sensory cues from idiothetic and allothetic sources. The computational mechanisms of mammalian brains in integrating different sensory modalities under uncertainty for navigation is enlightening for robot navigation. We propose a Bayesian attractor network model to integrate visual and vestibular inputs inspired by the spatial memory systems of mammalian brains. In the model, the pose of the robot is encoded separately by two subnetworks, namely head direction network for angle representation and grid cell network for position representation, using similar neural codes of head direction cells and grid cells observed in mammalian brains. The neural codes in each of the sub-networks are updated in a Bayesian manner by a population of integrator cells for vestibular cue integration, as well as a population of calibration cells for visual cue calibration. The conflict between vestibular cue and visual cue is resolved by the competitive dynamics between the two populations. The model, implemented on a monocular visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) system, termed NeuroBayesSLAM, successfully builds semi-metric topological maps and self-localizes in outdoor and indoor environments of difference characteristics, achieving comparable performance as previous neurobiologically inspired navigation systems but with much less computation complexity. The proposed multisensory integration method constitutes a concise yet robust and biologically plausible method for robot navigation in large environments. The model provides a viable Bayesian mechanism for multisensory integration that may pertain to other neural subsystems beyond spatial cognition.},

The modeling involves a detailed neural network for biological plausibility and a simplified equivalent network, better suited for robotic implementation. Using both simulations and robotic experiments, we show the efficiency of Multiwave for path planning. Multiwave is relevant not only to neuroscience, as the detailed model is biologically grounded, but also to robotic applications, as the simplified model is suitable for analog implementation on neuromorphic hardware.},

However, NLMs are very computationally demanding largely due to the computational cost of the decoding process, which consists of a softmax layer over a large vocabulary. We observe that in the decoding of many NLP tasks, only the probabilities of the top-K hypotheses need to be calculated preciously and K is often much smaller than the vocabulary size. This paper proposes a novel softmax layer approximation algorithm, called Fast Graph Decoder (FGD), which quickly identifies, for a given context, a set of K words that are most likely to occur according to a NLM. We demonstrate that FGD reduces the decoding time by an order of magnitude while attaining close to the full softmax baseline accuracy on neural machine translation and language modeling tasks. We also prove the theoretical guarantee on the softmax approximation quality.},

Thus, the configuration of a network that provides optimal or suboptimal navigation efficiency is a question of interest. It has been proved that complete graphs have the exact minimum Kemeny constant over all graphs. In this paper, by using another method we first prove that complete graphs are the optimal networks with a minimum Kemeny constant, which grows linearly with the network size. Then, we study the Kemeny constant of a class of sparse networks that exhibit remarkable scale-free and fractal features as observed in many real-life networks, which cannot be described by complete graphs. To this end, we determine the closed-form solutions to all eigenvalues and their degeneracies of the networks. Employing these eigenvalues, we derive the exact solution to the Kemeny constant, which also behaves linearly with the network size for some particular cases of networks. We further use the eigenvalue spectra to determine the number of spanning trees in the networks under consideration, which is in complete agreement with previously reported results. Our work demonstrates that scale-free and fractal properties are favorable for efficient navigation, which could be considered when designing networks with high navigation efficiency.},

  abstract = {Algorithms have become a widespread trope for making sense of social life. Science, finance, journalism, warfare, and policing\textemdash there is hardly anything these days that has not been specified as ``algorithmic.'' Yet, although the trope has brought together a variety of audiences, it is not quite clear what kind of work it does. Often portrayed as powerful yet inscrutable entities, algorithms maintain an air of mystery that makes them both interesting and difficult to understand. This article takes on this problem and examines the role of algorithms not as techno-scientific objects to be known, but as a figure that is used for making sense of observations. Following in the footsteps of Harold Garfinkel's tutorial cases, I shall illustrate the implications of this view through an experiment with algorithmic navigation. Challenging participants to go on a walk, guided not by maps or GPS but by an algorithm developed on the spot, I highlight a number of dynamics typical of reasoning with running code, including the ongoing respecification of rules and observations, the stickiness of the procedure, and the selective invocation of the algorithm as an intelligible object. The materials thus provide an opportunity to rethink key issues at the intersection of the social sciences and the computational, including popular concerns with transparency, accountability, and ethics.},

  title = {{Navigating with grid-like representations in artificial agents}},
  abstract = {Most animals, including humans, are able to flexibly navigate the world they live in \textendash{} exploring new areas, returning quickly to remembered places, and taking shortcuts. Indeed, these abilities feel so easy and natural that it is not immediately obvious how complex the underlying processes really are. In contrast, spatial navigation remains a substantial challenge for artificial agents whose abilities are far outstripped by those of mammals.In 2005, a potentially crucial part of the neural circuitry underlying spatial behaviour was revealed by an astonishing discovery: neurons that fire in a strikingly regular hexagonal pattern as animals explore their environment. This lattice of points is believed to facilitate spatial navigation, similarly to the gridlines on a map. In addition to equipping animals with an internal coordinate system, these neurons - known as grid cells - have recently been hypothesised to support vector-based navigation. That is: enabling the brain to calculate the distance and direction to a desired destination, ``as the crow flies,'' allowing animals to make direct journeys between different places even if that exact route had not been followed before.The group that first discovered grid cells was jointly awarded the 2014 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for shedding light on how cognitive representations of space might work.},
